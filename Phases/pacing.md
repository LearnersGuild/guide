# Pacing Requirement

You should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising your learning. The first three phases contain curriculum that you should be able to complete in 5 weeks. It should take you six \(6\) weeks, including [Phase Interview](//Phases/Interviews/README.md), to complete any of the first three phases. Eight \(8\) weeks is the maximum amount of time you can spend in phases 1, 2 or 3, respectively. To advance from one phase to another you must request a [Phase Interview](//Phases/Interviews/README.md) to interview into the next phase.

You may choose to complete a Phase Interview at any time during the phase, but, there are two rules:

1. **A Phase Interview may only be attempted **_**twice**_**.**
2. **A learner must **_**complete and pass**_** the phase interview no later than the 8th week after they begin the phase.**

See the [Phase Interview](//Phases/Interviews/README.md) section for more details on how Phase Interviews work.
