# Pacing Recommendations

You should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising your learning. We encourage you to interview out of the first two phases as soon as you feel ready, but preferably before your 8th week. For most learners, this means interviewing in week 6 or 7, if not sooner. Keep in mind that the longer you spend in the earlier phases, the less time you'll have available to work in the apprenticeship phase. To advance from one phase to another you must request a Phase Interview.

You may choose to complete a Phase Interview at any time during the phase, but, there are two rules:

1. **A Phase Interview may be attempted more than once, but you must wait a full two weeks between attempts. **In other words, if you attempt an interview in week 5, you cannot reattempt the interview until Monday of week 8. 

See the [**Phase Interview**](//Phases/Interviews/README.md) section for more details on how Phase Interviews work.
