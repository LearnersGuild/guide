# Pacing

Learners should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising their learning. The first three phases contain curriculum that Learners should be able to complete in 5 weeks. It should take a learner six \(6\) weeks, including phase interview, to complete any of the first three phases. Eight \(8\) weeks is the maximum amount of time a learner can spend in phases 1, 2 or 3, respectively.

Learners may choose to complete a phase interview at any time during the phase, but, there are two rules:

1. A Phase Interview may only be attempted _twice_.
2. A learner must _complete and pass_ the phase interview no later than the 8th week after they begin the phase.
3. Review the outline for each phase below, and follow the links to read the phase-specific curriculum. Note that the curriculum is a living system, and will be shifting and improving over time.
