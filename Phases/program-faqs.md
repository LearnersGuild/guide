# Learning Model FAQs

### Learning Phases

#### How long should it take a learner to complete a phase?

Learners should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising their learning. It should take a learner six \(6\) weeks, including phase interview, to complete any of the first three phases. Eight \(8\) weeks is the maximum amount of time a learner can spend in phases 1, 2 or 3, respectively. We strongly recommend requesting a Phase Interview as soon as a learner feels ready. See Phase Interviews for more information.

#### How do I know which phase I’m in?

Upon enrollment, all learners begin in Phase 1, also referred to as Phase 1, Programming Fundamentals. Learners then interview into each phase via Phase Interviews. You can see your phase placement in your Echo learner profile.

#### Is someone responsible for ‘running’ each phase?

An SEP is assigned to each phase. Foundations 1 and 2 also have assigned pro-coaches.

#### How do learners advance from one phase to another?

The Guild requires learners to participate in a coding challenge and technical comprehension interview to advance from one phase to another. Together, we call the coding challenge and technical comprehension interview, a Phase Interview. See [Phase Interviews](//Phases/Interviews/README.md) section for more details.

#### Can learners return to a previous phase after they’ve moved on?

No. If a learner successfully interviews into the next phase, they cannot return to a previous phase.

#### Are unused weeks in a phase rolled over if a learner interviews out of a phase early?

No, not exactly. If a learner moves into phases 2, 3, or 4 early, the weeks they did not spend in the previous phase may be added to their time in the Apprenticeship and Career Prep phases, rather than added to the phase they’re entering. Ultimately, you will still have up to 40 weeks in the program, however, the distribution of weeks per phase depends upon whether a learner uses 8 full weeks to advance through each of the first three phases \(totaling 24 weeks\).

#### What counts as a successful Phase Interview?

Learners who complete and understand 80% or more of the content covered in their phase interview will be accepted into the phase for which they’re interviewing.

#### How many times can a learner take a Phase Interview?

Learners may attempt a phase interview twice within the eight-week time period.

#### Will I be asked to leave the Guild if I have two unsuccessful Phase Interviews?

Yes, your membership may be terminated as a result of two unsuccessful attempts at entering a new phase.

#### How do learners access the curriculum for each phase?

Visit the curriculum repo: [https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum. ). 

#### Are all learners required to submit a retrospective at the end of the week?

Only Learners in Phases 3 and 4 are required submit weekly retrospectives.
