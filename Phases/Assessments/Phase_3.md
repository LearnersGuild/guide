# Phase 3 Assessment

The phase 3 assessment will test your ability to combine all of your foundational skills to build real, full-stack web applications both alone and in small teams.

Note that the phase 3 assessment differs significantly from the previous assessments in that you will be **pair programming as part of your evaluation interview**. A key skill to learn in phase 3 is how to build code in team, and the interviewer will be assessing your ability to work with them to build out a feature.

## Skills Assessed

- HTTP Applications (Intermediate Level)
- HTML & CSS (Intermediate Level)
- HTTP (Intermediate Level)
- SQL (Intermediate Level)
- Programming (Intermediate Level)

Some examples of specific things you _may_ be required to do as part of the assessment (this is **not** an exhaustive list):

- Build full-stack, database-backed web application with Node.js + Express, Postgres, and EJS
- Implement user authentication (sign in with username + password)
- Use an HTML templating tool like EJS to render dynamic data from a server
- Parse form data from an HTTP POST request
- Design an evented program architecture
- Write clean, well-factored code
- Closely follow specifications and mockups/wireframes in your implementation
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive data

### Secondary Skills

The following skills are _important_ but will likely not be _explicitly_ assessed for. You will need some fluency in them in order to complete the assessment.

- Pair/Team Programming (Beginner Level)
  - example: review code in pull requests
- Git & GitHub (Intermediate Level)
  - example: resolve merge conflicts from the command line
- Dev Ops (Beginner Level)
  - example: deploy a web app to Heroku
