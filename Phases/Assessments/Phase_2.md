# Phase 2 Assessment

The phase 2 assessment will test your ability to write more complex JavaScript programs for the Node.js platform, to create simple HTTP applications, to write HTML & CSS to give structure and style to a web page, and to design and interact with more complex relational databases.

You will _not_ be assessed on your ability to build full-stack web apps. You will be asked to build features for a front-end or back-end environment, but not both at once.

## Skills Assessed

- HTML & CSS (Beginner Level)
- HTTP / Web Applications (Beginner Level)
- HTTP (Beginner Level)
- Asynchronous Programming (Beginner Level)
- Node.js (Intermediate Level)
- Testing (Intermediate Level)
- SQL (Intermediate Level)

Some examples of specific things you _may_ be required to do as part of the assessment (this is **not** an exhaustive list):

- Create static HTML & CSS pages from mockups and wireframes
- Use SQL to persist data from within a node program
- Build a web server with Node.js and Express
- Apply asynchronous programming patterns in JavaScript (example: callback functions)
- Throw custom errors from JavaScript
- Implement RESTful routing in a web app for CRUD behavior
- Store data in browser cookies
- Send XHR requests from JavaScript running in a browser
- Manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript and common libraries like jQuery
- Create and query with join tables in SQL
- Make queries to a PostgreSQL database from within a Node.js program

### Secondary Skills

The following skills are _important_ but will likely not be _explicitly_ assessed for. You will need some fluency in them in order to complete the assessment.

- Debugging (Beginner Level)
  - example: use Chrome developer tools inspect the DOM
- Git & GitHub (Intermediate Level)
  - example: create branches and pull requests
