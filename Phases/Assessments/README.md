# Phase Assessments

This document explains how phase assessments will work. To learn what each phase assessment will cover and how to prepare, see the phase-specific assessment pages:

- [Phase 1](./Phase_1.md)
- [Phase 2](./Phase_2.md)
- [Phase 3](./Phase_3.md)

Note that there is no assessment for phases 4 or 5.

## Schedule & Pacing

There are clear pacing expectations for every learner who joins the guild. Specifically, each phase is designed to contain curriculum that should be able to be completed in 6 weeks, but *must* be completed within 8 weeks. This pacing requirement *includes* the 1 week that will be necessary to go through the assessment process.

Learners may choose to complete an assessment at any time during the phase, but, there are two rules:

1. An assessment may only be attempted *twice*.
2. A learner must *complete and pass* the assessment no later than the 8th week after they begin the phase.

## The Process

**Note:** This process is identical *regardless* of which phase assessment is being attempted.

When a learner feels ready to attempt an assessment, a Moderator will manually assign them to a phase assessment. The lead coach for the project will be an SEP, and learners should have few or no meetings to attend during that week.

The Moderator will send Learners the link to their assessment challenge on Monday morning. Learners will then have **2.5 days** to work on their solution and complete as much as they can. Learners _must submit_ their assessment solution/artifact by **1pm on Wednesday**.

Evaluations and interviews start after lunch on Wednesday and continue until they are done, ideally before 6pm on Friday.

After the evaluation and interviews have been completed, the results will be sent to Membership to make a decision and inform the learner whether they passed.

## Preparing for the Assessment

Make sure to read the appropriate assessment overview page for the assessment you'll be taking ([1](./Phase_1.md), [2](./Phase_2.md), or [3](./Phase_3.md)). This is where you'll find the most relevant information about the assessment to guide your preparation.

In addition, we recommended that you take following steps to lessen the effects of test anxiety.

- Before the assessment...
  - Study the relevant skills and take notes for yourself.
  - Organize the code you've written for easy reference (the assessment is open-book).
  - Get plenty of sleep. Exercise. Eat well. Take care of yourself. :)
- During the assessment...
  - Make sure to read the instructions very closely.
  - Don't expect to complete everything, just do as much as you can.
  - Focus on the areas that play to your strengths first, then do the hard stuff. Feel free to jump around.
  - Take frequent, short breaks to rest your brain.

## Getting Support

As they are working on their assessment code, learners can ask their lead coach (who is an SEP) for support. For example, learners may have to ask clarifying questions about the goal or its specs, or may need help debugging strange environment or git issues.

They should not expect, however, the same level of in-depth support that would ordinarily be available on non-assessment projects. For example, it is unlikely that a learner's coach will "pair program" with them or do any kind of "cognitive apprenticeship". In most cases, the SEP will not even touch the learner's keyboard.

## Evaluation / Interview

Starting sometime after 1pm on the Wednesday of the assessment week, and once the project artifact for the assessment has been submitted, the two-phase evaluation begins:

1. **Artifact Evaluation**: private review, by an evaluator, of the code submitted
2. **Technical Interview**: a 30-45 minute, face-to-face technical interview (via video-chat) between an interviewer and the learner

### Artifact Evaluation

During the artifact evaluation, an artifact evaluator will privately review the code that was submitted. They are primarily looking at two things:

##### Does the commit history "tell a story"?

On a typical project, code evolves over time. Lines, modules, and functions are added over time, then later changed, or sometimes even removed. The commit history tells a story of how the person who wrote the code went about figuring out and solving the particular problem.

As an extreme example, if there was only one commit, with all of the final code included in working form, that would look suspicious.

If a learner follows good git hygiene (commit often, write clear commit messages, and push at least three times daily), this part of the evaluation should be straight-forward and not raise any flags.

##### How complete is the project relative to the specifications?

When evaluating completeness, the evaluator will:

- award full points for requirements that are definitively met by the artifact
- award partial or zero points for requirements that are partially or not at all met by the artifact
- count the number of "completed" requirement points
- divide the number of "completed" points by the total number of points
- convert this number to a percentage (0-100%)

### Technical Interview

During the comprehension evaluation, a comprehension evaluator will meet (via video chat) with the learner, in a 1:1 setting. Together (for about 30 minutes), they will dig in to various parts of the code that was submitted.

During this phase of the evaluation, the evaluator is trying to answer the following questions:

- Did the learner write this code themselves, or does it seem like it was blindly cut-and-pasted?
- Does the learner understand the code? Can they explain how it works?
- Is the learner aware of their own skill and knowledge boundaries?

To prepare for this assessment, learners should consider the following questions. These may or may not be things the assessor will ask about. Learners should be prepared to answer any of them.

- How are the project files organized? What does each file do?
- What is the role of this function or subroutine?
- How will the computer read this code?
- Why did you make this design decision?
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- How did you arrive at your solution? Walk through your commit history to show how your solution grew.

## Membership Review

After the evaluation & interview are completed, Membership will make a decision and inform the learner.

In most cases, the decision will be either one of these two options:

- **Pass**: learner continues on to the next phase
- **Fail**: learner begins membership exit process

If, however, the learner completes and fails the assessment _early_ (i.e. before the 8th week of their phase), then they can re-take the assessment again on or before the 8th week of their phase. Learners can only re-take an assessment once.
