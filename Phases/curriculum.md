# Phase Curriculum

To access the curriculum for each phase visit and bookmark [**https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/**](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/).

As mentioned on in the [Phases](//Phases/README.md) overview, P1 and P2 contain sequenced modules that you can complete in order, or as needed. Let's say you've acquired some P1 knowledge prior to joining the Guild, so you may not spend a ton of time with some of the early modules in that phase and go straight to the first benchmark. Or, you may choose to try the benchmark to see how much you know and/or can figure out, then work backwards to fill in your gaps. In P3 you'll choose from a selection of full stack apps to build and practice integrating the fundamentals you learned in the previous phases. For Area 45, you'll work closely with the SEP to fine tune your full stack skills and job readiness.

Note that the curriculum is a living system, and will be shifting and improving over time.
