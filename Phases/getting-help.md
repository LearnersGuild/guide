# Got Help?

Everyone needs a little help sometimes. In addition to SEP support, there are also pro-coaches available to answer questions and help you get unstuck. We recommend reaching out for help in the following order:

* Google it - no really, google it and google it again.
* Post a question in the \#Help channel.
* Request help from an SEP or procoach in your phase channel by typing:

  ```
                  @phase-1-help

                  @phase-2-help

                  @phase-3-help

                  @phase-4-help

                  @phase-5-help
  ```
