# Phase 4 Interview

In the phase 4 interview, you will be expected to demonstrate your ability to combine all of your foundational skills to build real, full-stack web applications both alone and in small teams.

Note that the phase 4 interview differs significantly from the previous interviews in that you will be **pair programming as part of your evaluation interview**. A key skill to learn in Phase 3 is how to build code in team, and the interviewer will be evaluating your ability to work with them to build out a feature. Learners taking the Phase 4 interview may use the internet for problem solving during the live coding portion of the evaluation when necessary. 

### Skills Evaluated

* HTTP Applications \(Intermediate Level\)

* HTML & CSS \(Intermediate Level\)

* HTTP \(Intermediate Level\)

* SQL \(Intermediate Level\)

* Programming \(Intermediate Level\)

Some examples of specific things you _may_ be required to do as part of the interview coding challenge \(this is **not** an exhaustive list\):

* Build full-stack, database-backed web application with Node.js + Express, Postgres, and EJS

* Implement encrypted cookie-based user authentication \(sign in with username + password\)

* Use an HTML templating tool like EJS to render dynamic data from a server

* Parse form data from an HTTP POST request

* Design an evented program architecture

* Write clean, well-factored code

* Closely follow specifications and mockups/wireframes in your implementation

* Use environment variables for storing sensitive data

#### Secondary Skills

The following skills are _important_ but will likely not be _explicitly_ a part of the coding challenge. You will need some fluency in them in order to complete the challenge.

* Pair/Team Programming \(Beginner Level\)

  * example: review code in pull requests

* Git & GitHub \(Intermediate Level\)

  * example: resolve merge conflicts from the command line

* Dev Ops \(Beginner Level\)

  * example: deploy a web app to Heroku
