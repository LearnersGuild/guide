# Phase 3 Interview

In the phase 3 interview, you will be expected to demonstrate your ability to write more complex JavaScript programs for the Node.js platform, to create simple HTTP applications, to write HTML & CSS to give structure and style to a web page, and delve deeper into SQL schema design and queries.

You will _not_ be expected to show an ability to build full-stack web apps. You will be asked to build features for a front-end or back-end environment, but not both at once.

### Skills Evaluated

- HTML & CSS (Beginner Level)

- HTTP Applications (Beginner Level)

- HTTP (Beginner Level)

- Asynchronous Programming (Beginner Level)

- Node.js (Intermediate Level)

- Testing (Intermediate Level)

- SQL (Intermediate Level)

- Git & GitHub (Intermediate Level)

Some examples of specific things you _may_ be required to do as part of the interview coding challenge (this is **not** an exhaustive list):

- Create static HTML & CSS pages from mockups and wireframes

- Use SQL to persist data from within a node program

- Build a web server with Node.js and Express

- Apply asynchronous programming patterns in JavaScript (example: callback functions)

- Throw custom errors from JavaScript

- Implement RESTful routing in a web app for CRUD behavior

- Store data in browser cookies

- Send XHR requests from JavaScript running in a browser

- Manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript and common libraries like jQuery

- Create and query with join tables in SQL

- Make queries to a PostgreSQL database from within a Node.js program

- Work with branches in git & GitHub

- Create, review, and merge pull requests on GitHub

#### Secondary Skills

The following skills are _important_ but will likely not be _explicitly_ a part of the coding challenge. You will need some fluency in them in order to complete the challenge.

- Debugging (Beginner Level)

  - example: use Chrome developer tools inspect the DOM
