# Phase Interviews

Phase Interviews enable you to move from one phase to another. As mentioned in the [Pacing](/Phases/pacing.md) section, it should take you six \(6\) weeks, including phase interview, to complete any of the first three phases. Eight \(8\) weeks is the maximum amount of time you can spend in phases 1, 2 or 3, respectively. You may choose to complete a phase interview at any time during the phase, but, there are two rules:

1. A Phase Interview may only be attempted _twice_.
2. You must _complete and pass_ the phase interview no later than the 8th week after you begin the phase.

All Phase Interviews begin on Monday at 9am and must be submitted for evaluation by Wednesday at 12pm. Following submission, the evaluating SEP \(also referred to as the "evaluator"\) will schedule a 30-45 minute, face-to-face technical interview \(via video-chat\) with you.

**Phase Interviews have two parts:** **a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview.** **The section below:**

* Provides tips for preparing for the Phase Interview
* Provides instructions for requesting and submitting your Phase Interview
* Provides an overview of the supports available to you while you work on the Interview ** **

### Preparing for part one: The Coding Challenge

Make sure to read the interview overview pages to find the most relevant information about the interview and to guide your preparation. In addition, we recommended that you take following steps to lessen the effects of test anxiety.

* Before the coding challenge:

  * Study the relevant skills and take notes for yourself.

  * Organize the code you've written for easy reference \(the interview is open-book\).

  * Get plenty of sleep. Exercise. Eat well. Take care of yourself. :-\)

* During the coding challenge...

  * Make sure to read the instructions very closely.

  * Don't expect to complete everything, just do as much as you can.

  * Focus on the areas that play to your strengths first, then do the hard stuff. Feel free to jump around.

  * Take frequent, short breaks to rest your brain.

#### Phase Interview Coverage

To learn what each phase interview covers and how to prepare, see the phase-specific interview pages:

* [Phase 2](./Phase_2.md)

* [Phase 3](./Phase_3.md)

* [Phase 4](./Phase_4.md)

Note that there is no interview for phases 1 or 5.

### Preparing for part two: Evaluation & Technical Comprehension Interview

#### Challenge Evaluation

After you've submitted your code, an evaluator will privately review the submitted code. They are primarily looking for two things:

* **Does the commit history "tell a story?"**
  * On a typical project, code evolves over time. Lines, modules, and functions are added over time, then later changed, or sometimes even removed. The commit history tells a story of how the person who wrote the code went about figuring out and solving the particular problem. As an extreme example, if there was only one commit, with all of the final code included in working form, that would look suspicious. If a learner follows good git hygiene \(commit and push often, write clear commit messages, etc.\), this part of the evaluation should be straight-forward and not raise any flags.

* **How complete is the code relative to the specifications?**
  * When evaluating completeness, the evaluator will:
    * award full points for requirements that are definitively met by the artifact 
    * award partial or zero points for requirements that are partially or not at all met by the artifact 
    * count the number of "completed" requirement points 
    * divide the number of "completed" points by the total number of points 
    * convert this number to a percentage \(0-100%\)

#### Technical Interview

During the technical interview, an interviewer will meet \(via video chat\) with the learner, in a 1:1 setting. Together \(for about 30 minutes\), they will dig into various parts of the code that was submitted.

The interviewer is trying to answer the following questions:

* Did the learner write this code themselves, or does it seem like it was blindly cut-and-pasted?

* Does the learner understand the code? Can they explain how it works?

* Is the learner aware of their own skill and knowledge boundaries?

To prepare, learners should consider the following questions. These may or may not be things the interviewer will ask about. Learners should be prepared to answer any of them.

* How are the project files organized? What does each file do?

* What is the role of this function or subroutine?

* How will the computer read this code?

* Why did you make this design decision?

* What are the inputs and outputs?

* How did you arrive at your solution? Walk through your commit history to show how your solution grew.

### Getting Support

The kind of support SEPs offer as you are working on the interview challenge is limited to clarifying questions about the goal or its specs, or may need help debugging strange environment or git issues.

They should not expect, however, the same level of in-depth support that would ordinarily be available on non-interview projects. For example, it is unlikely that a SEP will "pair program" with them or do any kind of "cognitive apprenticeship". In most cases, the SEP will not even touch the learner's keyboard.
