# Phases

There are 5 sequential learning phases in our web development program. A phase is an eight \(8\) week period of time in which Learners tackle a new a set of web dev skills, put skills into practice or are working on getting hired. To start phases 2, 3, and 4, Learners must successfully complete a phase interview which includes a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview. See more details in the [Interviews](./Interviews) section.

### Program Design

The arc of our 40 week program follows your growth as a web developer. The early phases offer more direct structure and concept sequencing, also known as scaffolding, than the later phases. The idea is that when we’re learning something new, we need tighter scaffolding and guidance, and as we acquire more mastery, we’re ready to work more independently, on more complex problems, in more novel settings. So the structure of the phases is meant to facilitate your transition from novice web developer to a more experienced apprentice.
