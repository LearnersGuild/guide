# Phases

There are 5 sequential learning phases in our web development program. A phase is an eight \(8\) week period of time in which learners tackle a new a set of web dev skills, put skills into practice or are working on getting hired. 

To start phases 2, 3, and 4, Learners must successfully complete a phase interview which includes a coding challenge and technical comprehension interview. See more details in the [Interviews](./Interviews) section.

### Pacing

Learners should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising their learning. The first three phases contain curriculum that should be able to be completed in 5 weeks. It should take a learner six \(6\) weeks, including phase interview, to complete any of the first three phases. Eight \(8\) weeks is the maximum amount of time a learner can spend in phases 1, 2 or 3, respectively. 

 with the expectation that learners take the phase interview in their 6th week. Phases 1-3 _must_ be completed within 8 weeks, so the latest a learner can take a phase interview is in week 8.

Learners may choose to complete a phase interview at any time during the phase, but, there are two rules:

1. A Phase Interview may only be attempted _twice_.
2. A learner must _complete and pass_ the phase interview no later than the 8th week after they begin the phase.

### Phases

Review the outline for each phase below, and follow the links to read the phase-specific curriculum. Note that the curriculum is a living system, and will be shifting and improving over time.

If you have questions or need additional phase-specific support, get in touch with the Software Engineering Practitioner \(SEP\) or pro coach assigned to your phase.

#### P1: Foundations 1

Foundations 1 is all about the fundamentals. It covers things like learning how to use the terminal, basic coding concepts, how to test code, and using basic SQL.

Here youâ€™ll develop fundamental skills so that you can begin to take on more advanced topics and projects.

Review the [Phase 1 curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum/tree/master/phases/1).

#### P2: Foundations 2

Foundations 2 delves deeper into foundational topics introduced in F1, while also introducing new material like how to create static HTML and CSS pages, build HTTP servers, and use the latest version of JavaScript to write asynchronous code.

To start Phase 2, you must pass the [Phase 2 interview](./Interviews/Phase_2.md).

Review the [Phase 2 curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum/tree/master/phases/2).

#### P3: Integrated Practice

Integrated Practice gives learners a chance to synthesize and utilize skills developed in Foundations 1 & 2 in both modules and small projects that mimic real world applications and require more creative problem solving.

To start Phase 3, you must pass the [Phase 3 interview](./Interviews/Phase_3.md).

Review the [Phase 3 curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum/tree/master/phases/3).

#### P4: Apprenticeship

In the Apprenticeship phase, SEPs and learners will collaborate on contributions to OSS projects and possibly on live, production systems like the LOS apps \(echo, idm, etc.\). SEPs will select projects and work with learners to identify appropriate issues to work on, and learners will be expected to submit pull requests to project maintainers.

To start Phase 4, you must pass the [Phase 4 interview](./Interviews/Phase_4.md).

Review the [Phase 4 curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum/tree/master/phases/4).

#### P5: Career Prep

Career prep supports learners with technical interview preparation, resume and online presence development, networking skills, and overall accountability support during the job search process.
