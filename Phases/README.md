# Phases

There are 5 sequential learning phases in our web development program. A phase is an eight \(8\) week period of time in which Learners tackle a new a set of web dev skills, put skills into practice or are working on getting hired. To start phases 2, 3, and 4, Learners must successfully complete a phase interview which includes a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview. See more details in the [Interviews](./Interviews) section.
