# Phases

There are 5 sequential learning phases in our web development program. A phase is an eight \(8\) week period of time in which Learners tackle a new a set of web dev skills, put skills into practice or are working on getting hired. To start phases 2, 3, and 4, Learners must successfully complete a phase interview which includes a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview. See more details in the [Interviews](./Interviews) section.

### Program Design

The arc of our 40 week program follows your growth as a web developer. The early phases offer more direct structure and concept sequencing, also known as scaffolding, than the later phases. The idea is that when we’re learning something new, we need tighter scaffolding and guidance, and as we acquire more mastery, we’re ready to work on more complex problems, in more novel settings. So the structure of the phases is meant to facilitate your transition from novice web developer to a more experienced apprentice.

In the Programming Fundamentals \(P1\) and Web Development Fundamentals \(P2\) phases you work through a series of modules at your own pace, focusing on mastering skills as you move through the curriculum. There are benchmark modules designed to test your understanding of the material you covered in previous modules - kind of like a self-assessment.

Once you interview into Full-Stack Projects \(P3\), we introduce the task of pairing and you have an opportunity to apply the foundational skills you acquired in P1 & P2 to building full stack apps, but not yet for live users. At the end of the week you'll submit a retrospective of your work for the week and have time to reflect on the collaborative problem solving process.

When you enter the Apprenticeship phase \(P4\), you’re focusing on full-stack, live system development, specifically on the Guild's Learning Operating System, that is, the internal tools we use to deliver the learning platform, while consulting with the SEPs for the phase along the way. Live code reviews occur regularly, and at the end of the week you demo your work and engage in mini code overviews.

By the time you land in Career Prep \(P5\) you’re turning your attention specifically to interview prep and the job search process.
