# Phases

There are 5 sequential learning phases in our web development program. A phase is an eight \(8\) week period of time in which Learners tackle a new a set of web dev skills, put skills into practice or are working on getting hired. To start phases 2, 3, and 4, Learners must successfully complete a phase interview which includes a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview. See more details in the [Interviews](./Interviews) section.

### Program Design

The arc of our 40 week program follows your growth as a web developer. The early phases offer more direct structure and concept sequencing, also known as scaffolding, than the later phases. The idea is that when we’re learning something new, we need tighter scaffolding and guidance, and as we acquire more mastery, we’re ready to work more independently, on more complex problems, in more novel settings. So the structure of the phases is meant to facilitate your transition from novice web developer to a more experienced apprentice.

In the Programming Fundamentals \(P1\) and Web Development Fundamentals you work through a series of modules on your own, focusing on mastering skills and moving through the curriculum at your own pace. There are benchmark modules designed to test your understanding of the material you covered in previous modules - kind of like a self-assessment.  

In phase 3, we introduce the task of pairing and you have an opportunity to apply the foundational skills you acquired in P1 & P2 to building full stack apps, much like the work that was previously happening in Level 2

In phase 4, you’re graduating to larger code-bases, working on existing open source projects and consulting with SEPs along the way

And finally in phase 5, you’re turning your attention specifically to interview prep and the job search process

  
So, because learning looks a little different in each of these phases, the corresponding learning supports will look different, depending on which phase you’re in.
