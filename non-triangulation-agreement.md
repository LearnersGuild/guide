# Non Triangulation Agreement

**Purpose:**The intention of this agreement is to support a low-drama, low-politics culture: A team where everyone is confident that they are respected and honored when they're not present.

**Serves Values:**Safety, Being in Relationship

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. If you mention someone's name when they're not present do it in the same way you would if they were present. If you have feedback for someone, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it to them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation.

If you have feedback for supporting staff, or other stakeholders, do your best to give it directly to them. If that's not possible/efficient/effective it's OK to talk about them with someone else.
