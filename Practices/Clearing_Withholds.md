# Clear personal tensions swiftly and directly

We are human. Personal conflicts will come up as we work together. When you feel that something personal is beginning to get in the way of you working optimally with another partner, **address it directly with them as soon as you can.**

We call this practice "clearing a withhold".

A withhold is anything that I'm "holding" in my mind or heart, that's keeping me from feeling "clear" with you.

Withholds come in many different flavors:

* **A Pinch:** Something someone did, that "pinched" my ego. I could let it go, but it's building a small level of resentment, so I'll just say it. For example: "When you didn't respond to that question I asked in the meeting I felt snubbed". Pinches are quick to resolve, and usually don't need more than a "thank you" in response.

* **A Reality Check:** We make up stories all the time about each other. If you notice a belief forming in your mind about someone else, ask them about it. For example: "I noticed that whenever I talk about anything related to marketing, you seem to zone out. I'm starting to make up a story in my mind that you think I'm shitty at marketing. Is there any truth to that?"

* **A Reflection:** We can see things in others that they don't see in themselves. Sometimes it's important to make room for a reflection in order to clear the air between us. Reflections can be "negative" or "positive" feedback about how we are relating personally to someone. This is distinctly different from feedback about their work product. For example: "Your accent reminds me of this guy who used to bully me, and sometimes I notice myself mad at you for no reason." or "I really like your writing style. I've always wanted to write like that and sometimes I notice that I feel intimidated and jealous of you."

Sharing reflections in this way, and being heard, can often diffuse the withhold, and reduce its charge.

Another good use of sharing a reflection, is with regards to the Five Personal Practices. Because these practices are interpersonal, giving and receiving reflections from each other on our progress and the areas where we need to practice more supports them in staying alive.

If you tried to clear a withhold with someone and failed, use our [Conflict Resloution Process](/Processes/Conflict.md) to resolve it.
