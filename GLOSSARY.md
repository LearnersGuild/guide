## Apprentice
The apprentice stage is the first stage of learning a craft. Learners admitted to a chapter begin their journey as an apprentice. Apprentices are paid an optional minimal stipend and their primary responsibility is to advance the learning of everyone in their cohort, including themselves.

## Chapter
Chapters are the centers of learning within Learners Guild. They are communities of practice designed for intensive, deliberate learning and growth.

## Cohort
A cohort is a set of learners with a shared start date and chapter.

## Craft
Learners are involved with one or more crafts. These are the industries and skills which learners practice and work in. Web development is an example of a craft, as is graphic design, forestry, and photovoltaic technology.

## Guild Core
The Guild Core is the central organizational body of Learners Guild. The Core is responsible for all business and operational functions not explicitly under the domain of the chapters. The core is not explicitly geography-specific.

## Learner
A member of Learners Guild who is learning and practicing a craft. Learners include Apprentices and Practitioners.

## Partner
Partner is the term we use for people who work in the Guild Core. A partner is an employee of the Learners Guild who has an open ended, fixed employment.

## Practitioner
Practitioners are learners who are being paid to practice their craft. Their primary responsibilities are to their projects and to their own continued development and refinement of their craft.

## Stakeholder
Stakeholders include all partners and learners in addition to affinity organizations, investors, board, customers, and anyone else interacting with—or impacted by—Learners Guild.
