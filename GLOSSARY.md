## Chapter

Chapters are the centers of learning within Learners Guild. They are communities of practice designed for intensive, deliberate learning and growth.

## Craft

Learners are involved with one or more crafts. These are the industries and skills which learners practice and work in. Web development is an example of a craft, as is graphic design, forestry, and photovoltaic technology.

## Guild Core

The Guild Core is the central organizational body of Learners Guild. The Core is responsible for all business and operational functions not explicitly under the domain of the chapters. The core is not explicitly geography-specific. The core is often referred to as the "Guild Staff."

## Guild Member {#guild-member}

Someone currently or previously enrolled at Learners Guild to learn and practice the craft of web development.

## Guild Alum {#alum}

Any former Learner who remained in the program beyond their 5th week. Please note that we are intentionally using the informal term "alum" rather than "alumni/alumnae" so as not to reference gender when referring to former Learners.

## Learner

A Guild Member who is actively participating in the Learners Guild program to learn and practice the craft of web development.

## Learning Facilitator {#learning-facilitator}

A professional facilitator on the Learners Guild staff \(Partner\) responsible for stewarding Guild culture through COS development, facilitating House Meetings, and providing nontechnical learning support to Guild Learners.

## **Membership Cancellation Period** {#membership-cancellation-period}

The Guild or a Learner may initiate membership cancellation during the first five weeks of the program. In this case, the Learner leaves the Guild and financial obligations are terminated. Membership cancellation means the departing Learner does not retain access to any of the Guild's programmatic offerings.

## Phase Interview {#phase-interview}

A coding challenge and technical comprehension interview with an SEP that enables Learners to advance from one phase to another. Learners can attempt a phase interview twice within a phase.

## Software Engineering Practitioner \(SEP\)

A software engineer on the Learners Guild staff \(Partner\) who provides daily learning support for a specific learning phase.

## Stakeholder

Stakeholders include all partners and learners in addition to affinity organizations, investors, board, customers, and anyone else interacting with—or impacted by—Learners Guild.
