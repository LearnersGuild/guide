## Apprentice

The apprentice stage is the first stage of learning a craft. Learners admitted to a chapter begin their journey as an apprentice. Apprentices are paid an optional minimal stipend and their primary responsibility is to advance the learning of everyone, including themselves.

## Chapter

Chapters are the centers of learning within Learners Guild. They are communities of practice designed for intensive, deliberate learning and growth.

## Craft

Learners are involved with one or more crafts. These are the industries and skills which learners practice and work in. Web development is an example of a craft, as is graphic design, forestry, and photovoltaic technology.

## Guild Core

The Guild Core is the central organizational body of Learners Guild. The Core is responsible for all business and operational functions not explicitly under the domain of the chapters. The core is not explicitly geography-specific.

## Guild Member

Someone currently or previously enrolled at Learners Guild to learn and practice the craft of web development.

## Guild Alum {#alum}

Any former Learner who remained in the program beyond their 5th week. We are intentionally using the informal term "alum" rather than "alumni/alumnae" so as not to reference gender when referring to former Learners.  

## Learner

## Learning Facilitator

A professional facilitator on the Learners Guild staff \(Partner\) responsible for stewarding Guild culture through COS development, facilitating Learner Support Groups, and providing nontechnical learning support to Guild members.
