# Strategies

Learning strategies for [individuals](Individual.md), [teams](Team.md), [communities](Community.md), and [solo reflection](Reflection.md).

These categories do not have strict boundaries between them: they are all complimentary and overlap in many places. We just use separate files to make it easier to find and reference them.

We also made a [nice picture!](Strategies/Manifesto.md)

## Why Strategies

At Learners Guild, we are co-building an environment that is highly conducive to learning and growth.

This is not easy.

We are used to authority being centralized. When authority is distributed, it means every participant has more power, and with it, more decisions and more responsibility.

In the same way that a citizen in a democracy has to be better informed and make more decisions than someone in a kingdom, a member of a learning collective carries more weight and autonomy than a student in a traditional educational institution.

There are lots of systems to negotiate. Decisions to be made. Mistakes are inevitable. It will not always be neat, or pretty, or organized, or productive. Learning is not a straight path.

It is far from impossible, though. We are constantly revising the systems by which we operate, and discovering better ways to be together, work together, learn together. Everyone's contribution matters.

Some of these discoveries get baked into the _structure_ of Learners Guild, but not every problem can or should be solved with structure. _Agency_ is a cornerstone, an essential component of a good learning environment that we will strive to maintain and protect.

With agency, the locus of much authority resides in the smaller groupings of humans: communities, teams, pairs, and individuals. It is up to them to decide how to navigate and utilize the systems, when to follow and when to strike a new path, where to focus their attention and energy.

Agency does not mean that everyone has to fly blind, however. We can freely develop, share, and apply **strategies** to help us learn better together.

We'll log our favorite strategies here. If you think of any that are missing from this list, please open a pull request.
