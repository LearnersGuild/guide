# Strategies for Community Learning

A collection of our favorite strategies for co-creating a community of learning.

Roughly organized in order of preference: proven, high-leverage strategies are listed before less-important ones.

If you have a strategy you'd like to add or edit, please consider [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Pay it Forward

Be generous with what you know. Learn by mentoring. Reflect other people’s power back to them.

## Let Feedback Flow

Choose truth over comfort. Don’t hold back. Be specific and kind. Review other people’s code. Receive feedback as a gift.

## Expose your Ignorance

Learn to ask great questions by having the courage to ask bad ones.

## Take Ownership

The guild is beta software. If you see something that needs fixing, fix it! Write goals. Open pull requests. Wash dishes. Leave the environment better than you found it.

## Ask for Help

We've been trained to be self sufficient. Untrain yourself. We need each other. Reach out for support.
