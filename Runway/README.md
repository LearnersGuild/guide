# The Runway 
## Required Prep

We said it before, and we'll say it again: you must complete all required prep work 1 week before your start date. Failure to complete prep work is grounds for potential withdrawal of your enrollment at the Guild. If you're withdrawn we will do our best to find you a future start date once you've completed the Required Prep, but can't guarantee it. 

You should set aside 40 to 100 hours for this prep work, depending on your existing experience and skill level.

#### Javascript and HTML

Sign up for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and complete the following sections:

- HTML5 and CSS
- Basic JavaScript
- Object Oriented and Functional Programming
- Basic Algorithm Scripting (try to get through about half)

#### Development Environment and Tooling

- Download and install the [Atom][atom] editor
- Read chapters 1 and 2 of the [Atom Flight Manual][atom-flight-manual]
- Go through Codecademy's [Learn the Command Line][codecademy-cli] course
- Complete the [Try Git][cs-try-git] course

#### Non-technical Prep

## More Recommended Prep

Done with all the required prep? Great. If you have the time and resources,
keep going! These fundamental skills are needed for nearly all web development
projects:

- Reading and writing HTML and CSS
- Reading and writing JavaScript
- Applying computational thinking and reasoning to program design
- Building and deploying basic web pages
- Version control and project management with git and GitHub
- Using a command-line shell to navigate the filesystem and execute commands
- Using a professional text editor for writing code
- Typing, using shortcuts, and other general-purpose computer skills

Your focus should be on developing the above skills. The below tasks are good place to start, but you should by no means consider this an exhaustive list. Always be on the lookout for other resources and places to practice and grow.

## Exercise your Knowledge

As you read, research, and study, it is important to connect the data to its application by exercising your knowledge.

Whenever you are absorbing new information (by reading an article, watching a video, etc.), put that information into practice as soon as you are able.

For example, when reading a book about programming, spend some time at the end of each chapter implementing the concepts in code. Give yourself an example to play with, poke at, and ask questions of.

Doing this repeatedly will help to ground the knowledge you gain in actual experience, building intuition to supplement the facts.
