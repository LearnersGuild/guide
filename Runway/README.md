# The Runway

You've been admitted to a Learners Guild chapter. Your start date is coming up. What should you do to prepare?

The answer is unsurprising: practice, practice, practice. But not just any old practice, you should be engaging in [deliberate practice][wiki-delib-practice] and study. The more you know and are able to do coming in, the better you'll be able to learn and collaborate with your fellow learners.

Use this checklist of resources and suggestions to gain momentum in your learning before joining Learners Guild. None of these are required, but we do highly recommend doing as many as you can

## Required Prep

Before your start date, you need to make sure to have completed the required prep work. If you fail to complete it, make sure to let us know, and we will withdraw your enrollment from the Guild. If you're withdrawn we will do our best to find you a future start date once you've completed the Required Prep, but can't guarantee it. You should set aside 40 to 100 hours for this prep work, depending on your existing skill level.

Sign up for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and complete the following sections:

- HTML5 and CSS (2-4 hours)
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap (2-4 hours)
- jQuery (1-2 hours)
- Basic Front End Development Projects (10-30 hours)
- Basic JavaScript (2-6 hours)
- Object Oriented and Functional Programming (1-2 hours)
- Basic Algorithm Scripting (10-30 hours)
- JSON APIs and Ajax (1-2 hours)
- Intermediate Front End Development Projects (10-30 hours)
 - Build a Random Quote Machine Incomplete
 - Show the Local Weather Incomplete


## Strongly Recommended but not mandatory

The more you put into your experience at the Guild, the more you (and others) will benefit. We **highly recommend** you take the time to complete the following FreeCodeCamp tutorials before you join:

- Intermediate Front End Development Projects (10-30 hours)
 - Build a Wikipedia Viewer Incomplete
 - Use the Twitch.tv JSON API Incomplete
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (50 hours)
- Advanced Algorithm Scripting (50 hours)
- Advanced Front End Development Projects (150 hours)

## More Recommended Prep

Done with FreeCodeCamp? Great. If you have the time and resources, double down on your prep by going through the following:

#### Web Development Basics

These fundamental skills are needed for nearly all web development projects:

- Reading and writing HTML and CSS
- Reading and writing JavaScript
- Applying computational thinking and reasoning to program design
- Building and deploying basic web pages
- Version control and project management with git and GitHub
- Using a command-line shell to navigate the filesystem and execute commands
- Using a professional text editor for writing code
- Typing, using shortcuts, and other general-purpose computer skills

Your focus should be on developing the above skills. The below tasks are good place to start, but you should by no means consider this an exhaustive list. Always be on the lookout for other resources and places to practice and grow.

#### Development Environment and Tooling

- Download and install the [Atom][atom] editor
- Read chapters 1 and 2 of the [Atom Flight Manual][atom-flight-manual]
- Read this [introduction to the Mac OS command line][intro-cli] and try out the commands
- Go through the [Command Line Crash Course][cli-crash-course] and/or Codecademy's [Learn the Command Line][codecademy-cli] course
- Sign up for a free account on a cloud development environment service (like [Nitrous][nitrous] or [Cloud 9][c9]) and play with the features

#### Making Websites: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Read [20 Things I Learned About Browsers and the Web][20-things]
- Read and complete [Shay Howe's HTML & CSS lessons][shay-howe-htmlcss]
- Read chapters 1-10 of [Eloquent JavaScript][eloquent-js]
- Complete [Make a Website][codecademy-make-website], [Make an Interactive Website][codecademy-interactive-website], [JavaScript][codecademy-js] tracks on Codecademy
- Create and publish your own website with GitHub Pages (use [this Guide][gh-pages-guide])

#### Version Control and Project Management

- Get oriented to GitHub with [Hello World][gh-hello-guide], [Understanding the GitHub Flow][gh-flow-guide]
- Complete the [Try Git][cs-try-git] course
- Read and practice the [Mastering Issues][gh-issues-guide] and [Forking Projects][gh-forking-guide] guides
- Read [Mastering Markdown][gh-md-guide] and practice writing Markdown wherever you can

#### General Computer Skills

- Boost your typing speed to at least 50 WPM for regular English typing (any typing program will do, but this one is free: [keybr][keybr])
- Boost your typing speed to at least 25 WPM for programming language typing using [typing.io][typing-io]
- Practice shortcuts using [Shortcut Foo][shortcut-foo], especially the Atom, Command Line, Git, GitHub, Chrome Dev Tools, and JavaScipt Programming Dojos

## Exercise your Knowledge

As you read, research, and study, it is important to connect the data to its application by exercising your knowledge.

Whenever you are absorbing new information (by reading an article, watching a video, etc.), put that information into practice as soon as you are able.

For example, when reading a book about programming, spend some time at the end of each chapter implementing the concepts in code. Give yourself an example to play with, poke at, and ask questions of.

Doing this repeatedly will help to ground the knowledge you gain in actual experience, building intuition to supplement the facts.
