# Qualified Laptop

It's close to day one at the Guild and you need a new laptop. But there are tons of options out there and you're unsure of what qualifies as a Guild approved computer.

We have a few basic requirements and a couple of suggestions for your laptop purchase.

First, we require all Learners to use Mac laptops. We understand that that may mean learning a new OS and becoming familiar with a different UI if you're used to working on PCs. But the payoff in the long run is considerable. With everyone on the same platform we're able to offer better support and it's easier for Learners to collaborate with each other.

Second, we require Learners to use or purchase a Mac laptop that is no more than three years old.

Finally, we suggest shopping for a laptop that has the minimum specs below:

##### Models: Macbook Air; Macbook Pro

* 2.5 GHz+ processor
* 128GB+ hard drive space
* 4 GB+ RAM
* 13"+ screen
* USB & HDMI ports
