# Qualified Laptop

It's close to day one at the Guild and you need a new laptop. But there are tons of options out there and you're unsure of what qualifies as a Guild approved computer.

We have a few basic requirements and a couple of suggestions for your laptop purchase.

First, we require all Learners to use Mac laptops. We understand that that may mean learning a new OS and becoming familiar with a different UI if you're used to working on PCs. But the payoff in the long run is considerable. With everyone on the same platform we're able to offer better support and it's easier for Learners to collaborate with each other.

Second, we require Learners to use or purchase a Mac laptop that is no more than three years old.

Finally, we suggest shopping for a laptop that has the minimum specs below:

##### Models: Macbook Air; Macbook Pro

* 2.5 GHz+ processor
* 128GB+ hard drive space
* 4 GB+ RAM
* 13"+ screen
* USB & HDMI ports

### Loaner Laptops

In the event that you don't have a Mac, you can borrow one from us through the Foundations phase. When completing your Enrollment Agreement, make sure to select this option. Please be advised that borrowing a laptop requires a separate Lending Agreement and may require a security deposit.

#### Maintaining your Loaner Laptop

The Macbooks are covered under a 1-year Manufacturers warranty. While using the laptop, if you find a problem with it, notify Learners Guild and either exchange the laptop or take it to the nearest Apple store help desk for immediate assistance. To minimize potential for accidental damage, we highly recommend you use a protective hard case shell, screen protectors and a carrying case. These can be found at very reasonable prices on Amazon.com.

####  Returning Loaner Laptops

Your loaner laptop must be returned to Learners Guild Staff the Monday you begin the Practice phase, consistent with the terms of the Laptop Lending Agreement signed at the time of borrowing. Most likely, you'll return your laptop to the Office Manager.
