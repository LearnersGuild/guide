# Benchmark Goals

## Getting Support

*placeholder*
```
I think it's appropriate for learners to ask for help for anything that isn't directly related to what's being assessed. For example:

- clarifying questions
- weird environment issues
- git issues
- "chasing the tennis ball"

I don't think it's appropriate for learners to be learning what is being assessed in real time. For example:

- how iteration works in JavaScript
- how to set up routes in Express.js
```
