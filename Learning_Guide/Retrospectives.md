**How to measure relative contribution while pairing**

| Scenario | My Contribution | My Pair's contribution |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
|I am contributing technically (as defined above) while my pair is not physically present | 100% | 0% |
|I am contributing technically while my pair is physically present but checked out | 100% | 0% |
|I am contributing technically while my pair is actively engaged, doing their best to build/contribute with me, but unable to. They are present, focussed, apprenticing, asking questions, helping us stay focussed, but not able to really help with **hardly any** of the lifting. Besides the support I got from their presence, we did not ship any more features (or higher quality ones) because of them. | 90% | 10% |
|I am leading the technical contribution, with my pair fully engaged, and I am playing a significant lead role. My partner, however, is able to contribute to us shipping more code, and higher quality code to some degree. Without them, we would have shipped less code, of poorer quality. | 70% to 90% | 30% to 10%|
|We are almost contributing equal amounts, but I am carrying a more of the weight. Our project is significantly moved forward in completeness and quality because of my pair. Their technical contribution definitely helped us move forward. I am somewhat more effective than they are. | 55% to 70% | 45% to 30% |
| We pretty much contributed the same. I would have gotten half as done without them. | 45% to 55% | 55% to 45% |

If you could track every hour that you or partner worked on the project, and track which of the above scenarios applied, and average all of that, that would give you your relative contribution. Obviously it's way too tedious/inefficient to do that, so you'll need to approximate.

For example: "My partner was checked out for a couple of days **while I contributed a ton of core features**, but then they showed up and carried equal weight for two days, then led a little for the last day. So that's two zeros for the first day, two fifties for the third and fourth, and a sixty for the fifth, so 160/5 = 32% "

**Technical Activities**

Technical contribution is a result of *successfully* moving the project forward to completion by doing one of the following activities:

- Writing specs for the project
- Designing and planning project features
- Making, and communicating architecture decisions
- Actively building a core feature of the project (**core feature = defined in the spec**)
- Assisting other team members in completing core project features
- Getting coaching/Researching/Spiking/Reading in order to contribute to core project features
- Resolving bugs and conflicts in the code
- Reviewing pull requests and code that is part of core project features
- Writing tests that cover core product features
- Any time spent moving the project forward by soliciting and using the help of a coach or someone else


Note: A team member can contribute to any of the above activities either directly (hands on keyboard) or by actively pairing (engaged, thinking out loud, asking question, making suggestions, navigating, spiking, catching errors...etc.)

**What contribution is NOT:**

- Exploring tangential topics and ideas
- Developing non-critical features of the project
- Passively pairing / being an observer
- Contributing to team culture and/or team harmony
- Typing: Having hands on keyboards while their pair dictates/navigates/drives does not count as contribution unless the team member with their hands on the keyboard is also actively engaged in contributing, not just typing.


**Weekend and evenings:** You (or your pair) may choose to contribute to your project on weekends, or evenings. Make sure to be in partnership around that decision, and keep each other informed. The person who is working outside of official guild hours, is responsible for make sure their team is synced up. If you're working outside of core hours *you must ask for permission to contribute to core features* of the project. Relative contribution should only be measured in relation to *core features* being shipped. So, in general, unless your team is not on track to complete the project during core hours, only work on stretch specs during the evenings and weekends. In this case, that contribution does not count towards relative contribution. If your team is not on track to complete the project during core hours, then get their OK, and contribute towards core features outside of core hours, and count that towards your relative contribution.

**Coaching Support & Contribution**

Q: how / is coaching support factored into contribution? If I am at a meeting, my partner gets a coaching session without me and is able to move the project forward, does the progress during that coaching session count towards my partner's contribution, regardless of the nature of engagement between partner and coach? If it was a pure cog-app, does the partner not get (as much) credit for contribution?

A: any time spent moving the project forward, with or without the help of a coach, should count towards project contribution, in the same way that getting help as a pair counts towards both team members' contribution. we don't have a way of accounting for a coach's "contribution" to the project.
