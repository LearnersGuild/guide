## How to Review a Project's Completeness

When you are reviewing a project for completeness, you are holding the project team accountable to the specs:

There are a few steps that you should take to make sure that your review is useful and thorough.

- Make sure artifact is set. If it isn't, ask the team to set it.
- If applicable clone, and run project locally and verify all features are complete
- Run test suite locally
- Be rigorous. Don't give people the benefit of the doubt. If a spec is incomplete or unfulfilled, don't count it as complete.
- Give honest feedback. It's the only way we learn.
- If the specs aren't clear, and it's difficult to determine completeness from them, [write a PR to improve the spec, or file an issue](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues)

**Once you're done with a project code review, use `/review #team <completenessScore>` in slack to submit your completeness rating for the project.**
