# Review Guide

## Preparing your project for final review

If you forked an initial GitHub repository [click here](/Learning_Guide/Review/Forked_Repo.md).

If you created your own GitHub repository [click here](/Learning_Guide/Review/Initial_Repo.md).

__PRO TIP__: Ask your lead coach to score your artifacts completeness well before your final review on Friday. You DO NOT get partial credit for unmet specs so make sure you understand them and have actually met them.
