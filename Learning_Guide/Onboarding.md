# Learner Onboarding

Welcome to Learners Guild! This guide was developed to help you get settled and up to speed on our shared systems and space protocols. Got questions? Ask another learner who has been around!

## Read the Guides

These documents contain the latest and greatest information about our Learning Operating System \(LOS\) and Culture Operating System \(COS\). Almost anything you want to know about how things work at Learners Guild is contained in one of these documents:

1. Learning Operating System: Playbook: [https://playbook.learnersguild.org/](https://playbook.learnersguild.org/)

2. Culture Operating System: COS guide: [https://cos.learnersguild.org/](https://cos.learnersguild.org/)

## Join and start using Echo, Prrr, and Coach Que

* [Echo](https://echo.learnersguild.org/): You'll receive a special link to sign into Echo ~1 week before your start date. Browse the available channels and join any you want to follow. **Review the in-depth guidelines for using Echo **[**here**](https://playbook.learnersguild.org/Game_Manual/Echo.html)**.**
* [Prrr](http://prrr.apps.learnersguild.org/): Our internal pull review request system. Get your code reviewed by coaches and practitioners on a regular basis - aim for at least one PR per day!
* [Coach Que](https://coach-queue.apps.learnersguild.org/): Pronounced "coach queue", our internal system for booking coaching sessions with more advanced learners. You'll need to be logged into Echo before you can start using Coach Que.

Fun fact: Prrr and Coach-Que were built and are maintained by current Guild members.

## Join these Trello boards

We use these Trello boards to centralize important guild-wide information. Join by clicking on the links below:

1. [**Space Roles**](https://trello.com/invite/b/P6NuDGZH/f8dd29da8c1632d53ce4cdd5fcdb1ad8/lg-space-roles): a place where we capture and fill roles needed to share collective responsibility for keeping our space running smoothly. A different house will "host" the space by occupying the core space roles each month. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do your part to keep our shared space clean! This responsibility is shared by all of us.

2. [**Space Agreements**](https://trello.com/invite/b/KlCe030a/e568feb3c017b11ba8cfa08c471e12b2/lg-spaceagreements): agreements for how we co-exist in shared space. read more about these in the pinned post in the \#space channel.

3. [**Suggestion Box**](https://trello.com/invite/b/cDkOdyQf/edce94713af040e7816780e470aae8ea/lg-suggestion-box): a place to make requests, mainly items that may require resources on the part of LG to supply \(if you think we need to purchase something for the space\)

## Set up direct deposit for your living stipend

If you are receiving a living stipend, your first disbursement will arrive at the end of the second week of the program.

Set up direct deposit for your stipend disbursements by calling \(813\) 724-3411 x102. Setting up direct deposit during your first week ensures that you’ll receive your first stipend disbursement electronically rather than a paper check. You’ll need the following information: Bank Name, Bank Account Number, Bank Account Type \(checking or savings\), ABA Routing Number.

## Join the Oakland Guild Events calendar

We use the Oakland Guild Events calendar to schedule guild-related events that we should all be aware of. Reach out to Sylvan \(@nodatall on Echo\) or ZeZe \(@manoloish on Echo\), to be added to the calendar.

## Know the door code & hours

* Ask your onboarding mentor for the door code - please keep this code confidential and do not share with anyone outside of Learners Guild.

* The space is open from 7:00am to 10:00pm, Monday through Friday, and 10:00am - 10:00pm on Saturday and Sunday - you may only be in the space between these hours.

* The doors are "unfrozen" between 8:30am and 6:00pm - this means your code will **not** work outside these hours. If you arrive before 8:30am, enter through the main building using the elevator and rear doors. If you stay past 6:00pm, you must ring the doorbell to be let back into the building. **Never prop front or rear doors open.**

## Help keep the space \(especially kitchen & fridge\) clean

Our guiding principle for maintaining the space is: **Leave it better than you found it.** Here are some examples of what this principle looks like in action:

* All spaces are communal and flexible. When leaving an area you've been working or eating, clear & wipe down surfaces - leave it ready for the next person.

* Wash all dishes as soon as you use them - loading them into the dishwasher is fine, do not leave them in the sink. If you see stray dishes in the sink or on the counters, load them up too.

* Fridges are cleaned out of unmarked food on Wednesday and Friday. Mark your food, only eat what’s yours, and clear it out frequently! Leave communal food on the communal shelf or on the main counter - it will be eaten quickly :\)

* Use a bin or cubby to keep dry goods at the Guild during the week - because of limited fridge space, we ask that you only bring and refrigerate food that you are planning to eat that day - please do not plan to store food in the refrigerators for the entire week \(or longer\)

* Use care when sorting waste - we have separate bins for trash, recycling, and compost. If you don't know where something belongs, ask someone!
