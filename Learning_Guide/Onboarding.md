# Learner Onboarding

Welcome to Learners Guild! This guide was developed to help you get settled and up to speed on our shared systems and space protocols. Got questions? Ask another learner who has been around!

## Read the Guides

These documents contain the latest and greatest information about our Learning Operating System (LOS) and Culture Operating System (COS). Almost anything you want to know about how things work at Learners Guild is contained in one of these documents:

**Please be judicious with your use of @all notifications during work hours - unless a message requires everyone’s immediate attention, limit @all mentions to the hours before 9:00am and after 5:30pm. **

# Join these Trello Boards

We use these Trello boards to centralize important guild-wide information. Join by clicking on the links below:

11. **Space Roles**: a place where we capture and fill roles needed to share collective responsibility for keeping our space running smoothly. More senior learners will occupy all space roles for your first five to seven weeks here so you can focus on getting situated. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pitch in to keep our shared space clean! This responsibility is shared by all of us: [https://trello.com/invite/b/P6NuDGZH/f8dd29da8c1632d53ce4cdd5fcdb1ad8/lg-space-roles](https://trello.com/invite/b/P6NuDGZH/f8dd29da8c1632d53ce4cdd5fcdb1ad8/lg-space-roles)

12. **Space Agreements**: read more about these in the pinned post in the #space channel: [https://trello.com/invite/b/KlCe030a/e568feb3c017b11ba8cfa08c471e12b2/lg-spaceagreements](https://trello.com/invite/b/KlCe030a/e568feb3c017b11ba8cfa08c471e12b2/lg-spaceagreements)

13. **Suggestion Box**: a place to make requests, mainly items that may require resources on the part of LG to supply (if you think we need to purchase something for the space): [https://trello.com/invite/b/cDkOdyQf/edce94713af040e7816780e470aae8ea/lg-suggestion-box](https://trello.com/invite/b/cDkOdyQf/edce94713af040e7816780e470aae8ea/lg-suggestion-box)

## Setup Direct Deposit for your Living Stipend

If you are receiving a living stipend, your first disbursement will arrive at the end of the second week of the program.

1. Set up direct deposit for your stipend disbursements by calling (813) 724-3411 x102. Setting up direct deposit during your first week ensures that you’ll receive your first stipend disbursement electronically rather than a paper check. You’ll need the following information:

    1. Bank Name

    2. Bank Account Number

    3. Bank Account Type (checking or savings)

    4. ABA Routing Number

## Join the Oakland Events Calendar

We use the Oakland Guild Events calendar to schedule guild-related events that we should all be aware of. Reach out to Sylvan Swierkosz (@nodatall on Echo), to be added to the calendar.

## Know the door code & hours

1. Ask your onboarding mentor for the door code - please keep this code confidential and do not share with anyone outside of Learners Guild.

2. The space is open from 7:00am to 10:00pm, Monday through Friday, and 10:00am - 10:00pm on Saturday and Sunday - you may only be in the space between these hours.

3. The doors are "unfrozen" between 8:30am and 6:00pm - this means your code will **not** work outside these hours. If you arrive before 8:30am, enter through the main building using the elevator and rear doors. If you stay past 6:00pm, you must ring the doorbell to be let back into the building. **Never prop front or rear doors open.**

## Help keep the kitchen & fridge clean

1. Wash all dishes as soon as you use them - loading them into the dishwasher is fine, do not leave them in the sink. If you see a stray dish, go ahead and take care of it - let’s help each other keep our shared spaces clean.

2. Fridges are cleaned out of unmarked food on Wednesday and Friday. Mark your food, only eat what’s yours, and clear it out frequently!

3. Use a bin or cubby to keep dry goods at the Guild during the week - because of limited fridge space, we ask that you only bring and refrigerate food that you are planning to eat that day - please do not plan to store food in the refrigerators for the entire week (or longer)
