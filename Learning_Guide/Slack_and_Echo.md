# Slack & Echo

Echo is the persona that represents the LOS system. We use [Slack](https://learnersguild.slack.com/) as our primary system for communication at the Guild, and you'll occasionally see messages from [Echo](https://learnersguild.slack.com/messages/@echo/) in slack. You can sign-in to Slack at [https://learnersguild.slack.com](https://learnersguild.slack.com). You can also check out your stats at [https://game.learnersguild.org/](https://game.learnersguild.org/).

Echo and the LOS are under active development. If you notice something that could be better, or you encounter a bug, please [create a GitHub issue on the LOS repo](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/los/issues/new). We want your feedback. Together we can build a more perfect Learning Operating System.

## Slack Commands

Echo supports a variety of commands for interacting with the game right from Slack.

These include commands like `review` for reviewing projects, and `vote` for voting on goals.

To issue a command, type a forward slash `/` followed by the command name in the chat window of Slack. You can type commands from any channel.

When you type `/`, Slack will show a menu of the available commands and some hints as to their usage.

For many commands, passing the `-h` or `--help` flag will show you a helpful message about the command.

For example, to get help with the `/review` command, type `/review --help`.

**Slack is the primary means by which we communicate with each other** - we don't send email at Learners Guild. Because we have so many people communicating on a public platform, it's important to observe some shared Guidelines:

## Guidelines

These guidelines are to support us in making the most of this tool while minimizing distractions and maximizing learning:

#### Managing **OUTPUT**:

Guidance for managing the volume of posts and notifications we generate:

1. **Be discerning about WHO you tag - almost never use a `@channel` notification.** Only use an `@channel` notification if it's imperative that everyone in the channel read the message you have sent - assume they will, and that therefore you are interrupting the attention and focus of every person in that channel. `@channel` is the equivalent of ringing the gong. Would you ring the gong for this message? Differentiate between "I'd like everyone to read this" and "Everyone must read this". Posts in the \#watercooler channel, for example, never warrant an `@channel` notification, as it is an entirely recreational / optional channel.

2. **Be disciplined about WHEN you post.** Do people need to read your message RIGHT NOW? If not, it doesn't warrant a mid-day `@channel` notification. Unless it is urgent or an emergency, do not use an `@channel` notification between the hours of 9:00am and 5:30pm. You can also use the `@here` notification to notify only those folks who are online at any given time.

3. **Be thoughtful about WHERE you post.** Post information only in the most highly relevant places. If it's about the office space, use the \#space channel. If it's only relevant to November folks, use the cohort channel. If it's about a movie outing you want to plan, use the \#watercooler channel. If you find yourself posting something in three different channels, ask someone's opinion about where it belongs and only post it there. The \#significant-updates channel should be reserved for content that everyone in the Guild must be aware of in a timely fashion.

4. **Be sparing about creating new channels:** A new channel should only be created for an entirely new topic that will generate ongoing discussion. The more channel clutter there is, the less likely we are to pay attention.

#### Managing **INPUT**:

Guidance for managing the volume of posts and notifications you are fielding and suggestions for protecting your attention throughout the day:

1. **Choose your channels wisely**. Only join channels that you wish to stay up to date with. To ensure smooth Guild-wide communication, please commit to joining and monitoring the following channels, at a minimum: \#Oakland, \#YouHouseChannel, \#YourCohortChannel, \#significant-updates, and your project team channel for the current week. Choose your other channels carefully, hide or leave channels you're done with. Keep it clean.

2. **Make Slack a "pull", not "push" experience**. Decide whether you'd like to turn desktop notifications for Slack off during the day. Schedule set times that you'll catch up on messages - e.g. before standup, over lunch, and right before you leave. Make Slack work for you, don't work for Slack.

### Special drill down on @channel notifications:

`@channel` notifications are costly for our attention, flow, and productivity. You should almost never use them. Ask yourself: "does everyone really need to know about this?" If the answer is **NO**, get more strategic about who you tag or where you are posting. If the answer is **YES** and it's the middle of the day, then ask yourself...

"Do they need to know **NOW**? Is it worth breaking their attention? Would I ring the gong to announce it? Is it urgent or an emergency?" If the answer is **YES**, go ahead and post. If the answer is **NO**, wait to post it before 9:00am or after 5:30pm.

#### **Use an @channel notification for these types of messages**:

* \#oakland: `@channel` pools are broken, and being fixed. Ignore them right now, and let's meet at the light side for coach-queue presentation _\(Necessary to coordinate the whole group in real-time, ok to post mid-day\)_
* \#oakland: `@channel` I got a phone call late last night from Tish, head of our Old Oakland security team, who informed me that she found one of the front doors left ajar around 11:30pm. Please be conscious of making sure the doors are fully closed behind you, especially if you are leaving after 6:30pm. _\(Impacts everyone in the Guild, but not urgent - should be posted before 9:00am or after 5:30pm\)_

#### **Do NOT use an @channel notification for these types of messages**:

* \#space: `@channel` if you see a mac charger with a github sticker on it, please let me know. Thanks _\(Not necessary that everyone be notified about the missing charger - those who see the message will keep an eye out\)_
* \#oakland: `@channel` leaving early today. See ya'll tomorrow! _\(Not necessary to let everyone know if you have to take off early\)_
