## Coaching Guide

_Original author: Diana Vashti. Thanks Di!_

As a coach, the feel of the week is a lot different than working on goals. You have no specs, no codebase, and instead of a team of 1 or 2, you are working with the whole guild. You may have back-to-back "coach-queue" requests. With the change of pace and scenery comes a new set of skills that are ideal for sharpening during a week of coaching.

### What does my day actually look like?

As a coach you have 3 main responsibilities:

1. **Maintain available time for coach-queue sessions**. Keep yourself open during the day to respond to coach-queue requests.
1. **Hold daily stand up meetings for your teams at 9:00am**. These meetings should consist of every learner relating:
  - What they did yesterday
  - What they have planned for today
  - What is blocking them from making progress
    <br>_If a learner is blocked, you should request that they add a request to coach-queue, so that you can begin the day helping unblock your teams._

1. **Escalating code blocks and issues to SEPs or fellow coaches if you are unable to resolve the learners block during your appointment** (ideally, if after 15 minutes you do not feel you are on a solid path to debugging the issue, a coach should find an available SEP to bring in.)

## What relevant skills does coaching teach me?

A software engineer should be able to communicate clearly, ask great questions, help others ask better questions, and find poor code/logic quickly.

During a week of coaching, you should focus on the following:

### Context: Coach-queue sessions

- Am I asking high-quality questions? Was I able to communicate without words like: thing, stuff, and this/that/those.
- Can I quickly establish what I need from the learner to start helping them, and ask for it in a clear way?
- Can I be confident in a situation where I am expected to help find a solution with little context?
- How quickly can I determine if I am not able to help in a given situation and how do I respond?
- Can I communicate with teams who may be having both intrapersonal and technical blocks, and am I able to help coach both programming concepts and better team patterns?

### Context: Escalation

- Was I able to identify within 15 minutes if I needed to escalate?
- Did I feel comfortable admitting I needed to escalate, and am I able to still be confident in following coach-queue sessions after escalating.
- Was I able to ask high-quality questions of the learner/team so that I could describe to the SEP what the issue is, and where I found myself blocked.

## Additional Tips

- **You must stay with the SEP when escalating so you too can learn the solution to the problem**. This is one of the best opportunities to learn you may encounter. You attempted to solve a problem, and when you could not you get to immediately see how someone with a ton of experience solves the issue.
- **If a team does not know how to explain the situation to a degree you need to be helpful, focus on coaching them towards breaking down the problem into a more manageable chunk where they can describe the issue**. Three questions to consider are: What do you think the issue is? What have you tried so far? What would you expect if it worked?
- **Take breaks when you can. Coaching is full-time work, so make sure to pace yourself.**
