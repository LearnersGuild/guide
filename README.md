# Program Guide

Welcome!

This Guide[^1] is designed to support you in getting the most out of your experience as a learner at the Guild. It supplements the [**Curriculum Guide**](/curriculum.learnersguild.org) by offering an overview of the program features, learning resources and strategies, community guidelines and general Guild policies. In short, it's your one-stop resource for all Guild related information that is not immediately related to the content of your project work.

As a living and dynamic support for the way we work together, the Guide is subject to change, as such we reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw parts of it. Each learner is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this guide.
