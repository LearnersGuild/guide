# Learners Guild Playbook

TODO: Cleanup this intro and remove duplicates

Welcome!

At Learners Guild we are working to build a purpose driven organization, and a thriving learning culture. That’s an easy thing to want and say, but it’s difficult to practice. It takes active effort to articulate our guiding principles, and our values, and to express them day to day.

This repository contains all our agreements, policies, operating models, values and guiding principles. It is meant to be a living and dynamic support of the way we are working and learning together. As a startup, we anticipate changes will be made to this playbook in the future and reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw parts of it.

We are building a team that understands our mission and core values and will help us to advance these objectives. All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are very appreciated. This is a work in progress that we hope will get better with more time and more contributors.

Each learner is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this playbook. Our goal is to work together towards a learning environment that is constructive and supports both personal and professional growth.  

# Culture Operating System

This playbook exists to provide a framework by which members of our learning collective can co-create conditions/climate/space/environment/culture that draws out the best in us.

The COS defines the components of our culture, and processes by which participants of the culture can impact it.

Learners Guild embodies this commitment by deliberately creating a culture that supports our ongoing development on a daily basis. An ecosystem of structures, practices, tools, and shared language allow us to do this. Everyone is responsible for embodying and improving this culture.

Acknowledge and use the water you’re swimming in. We shape culture; culture shapes us. A powerful, positive culture is the strongest, most pervasive support structure a learning community can have. Develop collective mastery rather than restrictive rule-making. Intentional culture building supports intentionality in other domains as well.

Critically, we manage our business culture like we manage our learning culture: embodying in our own practices what we expect from our learners and partners. The cultural architecture we develop and implement internally for ourselves will serve as the foundation for the learning culture that we offer to our members.[^1]
