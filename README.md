# Learner Guide

Welcome!

Learners Guild's mission is to make pathways to tech jobs more accessible for anyone who is willing and able to become a web developer by investing in their potential, inviting them to participate in, and contribute to, a thriving learning culture, and providing learning supports along the way.

This Guide is the official repository for all of our agreements, policies, operating models, values and guiding principles. It is meant to orient you to how learning happens at the Guild by offering an overview of the learning model and how you progress through it, as well as resources and strategies for learning. The Guide also shares Guild policies and the terms of Guild membership.

As a living and dynamic support for the way we work and learn together, the Guide is subject to change, as such we reserve the right to amend, revise and/or withdraw parts of it. Feedback and suggestions \(especially in the form of pull requests to the guide repo\) are very appreciated.

Each learner is responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with this guide. Our goal is to work together towards a learning environment that is constructive and supports both personal and professional growth.

As a Learners Guild Member, each learner takes on two objectives:

* **Objective 1:** Work diligently to create and sustain a career as a web developer.
* **Objective 2: **Collaborate with others in building a learning culture that brings out the best in us and supports us in achieving the first objective.

## Learning Operating System

The LOS is a sequenced web development training platform that aids learners in building solid programming fundamentals and meta-learning skills in the early phases of the program and scaffolds towards  self-directed, project-based learning later.

In other words, it's the framework that supports us in achieving the first objective. The main way enrolled learners engage with the LOS is through [Echo](https://echo.learnersguild.org/) and our [Guild Curriculum](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/) web app.

To read more about the LOS, visit [Learning Phases](/Phases/README.md) section of the Guide.

## Cultural Operating System

We believe a powerful, inclusive culture is the strongest, most pervasive support structure a learning community can have. At the Guild, Learners rely on each other daily for coding and personal support, effectively building strong professional relationships and friendships that extend beyond their time at the Guild.

While LOS provides a framework by which we learn together, the [Cultural Operating System](https://cos.learnersguild.org/), or COS, defines the components of our shared culture and the processes by which members of the learning community can shape it. In short, The COS  is the framework that supports us in achieving the second objective of building a learning culture that brings out the best in us and supports us in achieving the first objective.

#### **What is our Shared Purpose as a Learning Community?**

> _Out of a great need_

> _Listen. The terrain around here_

> _Is far too dangerous for that._

As a learning community, our shared purpose is to cooperatively build a learning environment that brings out the best in all of us and enables us reach the first objective: creating and sustaining careers in web development.

There are a couple things in place to support learners in building a strong community.

* **The House System:** All learners belong to one of the six houses. A house is comprised of learners at various points in their time at the Guild. Houses meet twice monthly, giving learners dedicated time to offer and receive support, mentorship and encouragement.

* **Onboarding Mentors:** Every new learner is paired with an existing learner - their Onboarding Mentor - who helps them settle in and navigate Guild systems and resources during their first few weeks.

* **Affinity Groups:** Learner formed groups organized around shared identities, or interests.
