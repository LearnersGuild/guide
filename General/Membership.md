Learners Guild is proud to create a pathway to a dignified livelihood and to make that pathway accessible through the idea of _investment_. Learners Guild invests in your potential and aligns our incentives with yours instead of burdening you with fee-for-service debt that is disconnected from your outcomes. We don’t want to take your money if you don’t get a job. No thanks.

This means that we are selective about who gets to become a Learner at the Guild, and who we invest in. It also means that we hold high standards for how each Learner participates in our growing community. If you’re learning with us at the Guild, we are in good faith providing resources to you up-front in hopes that you will succeed in the near future. In order to secure our investment, we have the following expectations.

1. **Show up from 9 to 6**. Post in your house and project channels if you're running late or leaving early.
1. **Show up to Guild meetings**. (Including but not limited to onboarding meetings, 1:1's with staff, Monday All-Hands, Daily Standups, Friday Wrap-ups, COS Workshops) If you're running late, let the people you are supposed to be meeting with know ahead of time.
1. **Log time off if you will miss more than an hour of the day**. Email [timeoff@learnersguild.org](mailto:timeoff@learnersguild.org) to log a half (1-4 hours) or a full (4+ hours) personal or professional development day. Don't exceed 8 personal days, or 3 professional development days.
1. **Comply with** our [code of conduct](/Policies/Code_of_Conduct.md), [drug & alcohol policy](/Policies/Drug_and_Alcohol_Policy.md) and [building policies](/Policies/Oakland_Building.md).
1. **Respond to feedback with best intentions**, and demonstrate an interest in constant improvement.
1. **Stay on track to get a high-paying job as a software developer**. This means advancing into the phases at the required pace, and being career-focused and tenacious in applying for jobs.

When these expectations are not being met, our investment and thereby your membership will be cancelled.
