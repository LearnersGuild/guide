# Guild Membership

_Please note that while the Enrollment Agreement does not distinguish between termination of Learner’s membership and termination of Learner’s participation in the Program, this Learner Guide, updated August 17, 2017, defines Guild Membership, further acknowledges **two types of memberships**, and distinguishes between membership termination and termination of a Learner's participation in the program. As stated in the Enrollment Agreement, "In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Guide, the Guide shall govern."_

We carry out our mission to make pathways to tech jobs more accessible through the idea of **investment**.

We invest time, money and resources in aspiring web developers from all backgrounds who we believe will succeed in a rigorous, accelerated learning environment and develop the skills and mindsets necessary for a career in web development by the end of their time in the learning program.

As such, we are selective about who we invest in and invite into our learning community. It also means that we have high expectations for how each active [Learner](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#learner) participates in our growing community. If you’re learning with us at the Guild, we provide you with resources up-front in good faith and with the expectation that you'll succeed in beginning your career as a software developer and contribute back to the Guild. By investing in your potential we align our incentives with yours instead of burdening you with fee-for-service debt that is disconnected from your outcomes.

When you are accepted to Learners Guild, you join an ever-growing community of Members (Learners and Alums). If you remain in the program past your 5th week, your membership in the Guild remains active for as long as our doors are open. Our intention is to foster a diverse and engaged professional community that reaches far beyond your time as a Learner in the program.

All Guild members receive the membership benefits outlined below. Additionally, as a condition of our investment, there are some _**Non-negotiable**_ [_**Learner Expectations**_](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) that **every active Learner** is expected to abide by.

### Membership Benefits {#membership-benefits}

As stated above, all Guild Members have access to some basic membership benefits. As you progress through the learning program, you'll receive additional benefits to support your growth and enable you to launch your career as a software developer.

When you leave the program, you'll become a Learners Guild [Alum](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#alum) and will continue to receive the basic membership benefits available to all Guild members.

Being part of a supportive, diverse community of professionals is one of the reasons many people choose Learners Guild as their pathway to becoming a web developer. Regardless of how much time you spend in the program, you'll be a part of the community for life.

There are two exceptions:

First, if you decide to leave or are asked to leave the Guild during the membership cancellation period (your first 5 weeks), your membership with the Guild will be completely terminated. Second, if you are in violation of any of the [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md) the Guild reserves the right to revoke your Membership.

Membership benefits extended to active learners and alum:
