# Membership Reviews

Membership will review the data from each Phase Interview (both the coding challenge and the technical interview) and make a decision about whether or not a Learner may advance into the next Phase.

If a Learner is not granted access to the next Phase, the Learnerâ€™s investment cycle with the Guild will end.
