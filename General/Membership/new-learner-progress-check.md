# New Learner Progress Check :: Week 4

Joining the Guild is a two-way street. You're making a commitment to a 10 month program and to working for at least 3 years in the tech industry. We are making a commitment to invest in you - to invest technical and non-technical training, to welcome you into a vibrant community and to offer finanical support so you can land your first developer job. It's a big commitment for both of us. As such, itâ€™s important that we both get a sense of whether or not this is the right learning enviroment for you.

**During your fourth week at the Guild you'll be required to complete a coding challenge assessing how well you're progressing in our learning model and acclimating to our culture.**

The technical evaluation will cover modules you've completed during your first 3 weeks in Phase 1. We'll also explore how you're faring in the Guild's culture - are you maintaining Guild community agreements? Keeping up with your accountabilities? Using the interpersonal tools we've shared to maintain good relationships in the community, etc?

We base our decision to continue investing in you on the data collected via the week four New Learner Progress Check. At this time, Learners Guild may assess that we cannot continue investing in you and you may be asked to leave the guild. Conversely, you may decide that the Guild isn't the best place for you to pursue your career as a web developer and you can voluntarily terminate your membership without any finanical obligation to the Guild. See How to Leave the Guild for more information.
