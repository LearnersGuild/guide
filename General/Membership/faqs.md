OVERVIEW

Why is the learning model being upgraded? 

Lots of reasons. Here are a few:

It’s clear from your feedback and our observations that several things about the learning model weren’t optimal such as stats, levels, and lack of regular access to expert technical guidance and support.

The self-directed, project-based approach to learning that defines much of the program works well for learners who have reached a certain degree of proficiency, but tighter scaffolding is needed at the beginning of the program to build foundational skills, and additional resources are needed at the end of the program to better support learners in the job search process. 

Learners want and need a clearer picture of their technical progress, strengths, and gaps, and more guidance from experts every step of the way.

Stats are an unreliable data source for determining progress and membership decisions. We need a clearer, fairer, and more objective process for helping people understand their coding progress and job readiness.

 

What’s the summary of upgrades?

The program is organized into 5 distinct “phases.” Learners are required to move through a phase in no more than 8 weeks. To advance from one phase to another, learners complete a coding challenge and participate in a technical comprehension interview with an SEP.

What does this mean for learners? 

Everyone is required to interview into one of the five phases using the new interview system during the June 19 week. Upon being ‘sorted’ into a phase via interview outcomes every learner will officially begin in their new phase the week of June 26 and will have 8 weeks to successfully complete it by taking a phase interview. See below for more details on how the Sorting and Phase Interviews work. 

 

Does this apply to learners in the July and September cohorts?

Yes. Most July learners are officially done with their time at the Guild, but the opportunity to participate in the new structure is being offered to them as well. July learners should reach out to Carla or NeEddra to talk about their options. 



INITIAL SORTING INTERVIEWS & MEMBERSHIP 

Learners will be sorted into the new phases via the new interview system the week of June 19. Upon being ‘sorted’ every learner will officially begin their new phase the week of June 26 and will have a maximum 8 weeks to successfully complete it via phase interview with an SEP. We strongly recommend shooting for phase completion by week 6. See below for more details on how the Sorting and Phase Interviews work. 

 

What is this sorting interview?

We're calling this the Sorting Interview because its purpose is to sort learners into the optimal phase for their stage of learning.

 

What should I expect in the sorting interview?

The sorting interview is comprised of a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview. Read all about it in the learner Guide, here.

 

How are learners being assigned to the sorting interview they requested? 

Upon receiving everyone’s sorting interview preferences, the Learning Facilitators will assign each learner to their requested interview and provide additional instructions on June 19. 

 

What does next week’s schedule look like? 

At 9am on Monday, June 19, the Guild will meet for a brief all-hands meeting to discuss logistics and guidelines for completing the sorting interview. Learners will begin work thereafter. All coding challenges should be submitted by 12pm on Wednesday, after which point learners will be scheduled for the technical comprehension interview, sometime before Friday. In the meantime, feel free to review or work on any other independent work.

 

What happens after the Sorting Interview is complete?

Based on the outcome of this interview, learners will be placed into either Phase 1, 2, 3, or 4. We won't place anyone into Phase 5, but people beyond 32 weeks can choose Phase 5 over Phase 4 if they want to. 

 

Can the sorting interview be completed remotely?

Yes, once learners receive their interview assignment they are welcome to complete the coding challenge and comprehension interview remotely. 

 

What happens if a learner is not accepted into the phase for which they interviewed?

The Guild will most likely place them in the phase preceding it. In some cases, the interviewer may recommend that a learner work on skills two phases behind the one the learner interviewed for. For example, someone who isn’t accepted into Phase 4 \(Apprenticeship\) may receive guidance to build skills in Phase 2 \(Foundations 2\) instead of Phase 3 \(Integrated Practice\).  The learner may or may not take this advice. They can elect to join Foundations 2, or they can try Integrated Practice. Either way, the learner has a total of 8 weeks to advance out of the phase selected. 

 

Will learners have a full 8 weeks to move on to the next phase after sorting?

Yes. After being sorted into phase 1, phase 2, or phase 3, we expect most learners to interview in their 5th or 6th week of the phase. Learners may attempt a phase interview twice within an eight-week time period. The second interview must be attempted no later than the 8th week.

 

Will learners get extra time at the Guild if they interview into an earlier phase than would be expected based on their initial start date?

Yes, learners sorted into an earlier phase will have extra time at the Guild. 

 

If a learner is sorted into an earlier phase, is there additional stipend financing available? 

Learners interviewing into a phase that extends their time at the Guild can expect to have their existing financial support continue at its current level. Learners who did not take a stipend before can choose to sign a new stipend ISA now.

 

Does the stipend become taxable income if a learner receives it after the original 40 week period? 

If you receive a living allowance, there may be tax consequences that you should discuss with your tax advisor. We do believe that if you receive a living allowance and pay back less through your ISA payments than you previously received, this may be considered taxable income. Therefore, Learners Guild may issue you a form indicating the amount of the living allowance you received, which is filed with the IRS.

 

If a learner is placed into an earlier phase, but receives a job offer shortly after starting the new phase, does the timeline on the ISA pertain to the original 40 weeks or the revised timeline?

The ISA will pertain to the original 40 weeks.

 

If a learner is close to the end of their time at the Guild and wants to leave on their original end date what should they do?

All learners must take the sorting interview and be placed into a phase, thereby making it unlikely that a learner would complete the program on their original start date. If a learner wants to leave on their original end date, the learner may request to leave the Guild.  

 



LEARNING MODEL UPGRADES

PHASES

What is a Phase?

A phase is an eight \(8\) week period of time in which learners tackle a new a set of web dev skills, put skills into practice or are working on getting hired. 

 

How long should it take a learner to complete a phase?

Learners should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising their learning. It should take a learner six \(6\) weeks, including phase interview, to complete any of the first three phases. Eight \(8\) weeks is the maximum amount of time a learner can spend in phases 1, 2 or 3, respectively. We strongly recommend requesting a Phase Interview as soon as a learner feels ready. See Phase Interviews for more information. 

 

 

How do I know which phase I’m in?

Upon enrollment, all learners begin in Phase 1, also referred to as Foundations 1. Learners then interview into each phase via Phase Interviews. 

 

Learner profiles in Echo also list current phase. 

 

What are all of the phases?

Phase 1: Foundations 1 

Phase 2: Foundations 2 

Phase 3: Integrated Practice 

Phase 4: Apprenticeship

Phase 5: Career Prep 

 

What does each phase look like?

Phases 1 and 2: Foundations 1 and 2

Sequentially ordered learning modules that build on each other and focus on developing foundational skills. 

Learning Modules are comprised of skills outlines, resources, suggested Google search strings, and exercises to help you learn the skill.

Weekly Lectures

Lecture topics may not always align with the module a learner is studying in any given week.

Mostly solo work, pairing is not required. Collaboration and learning together are encouraged.

 

Phase 3: Integrated Practice

Application of skills gained in Foundations 1 and 2.

Begin working on full-stack practice projects like the Bookstore App and snapshot goals like Trossello. 

Voting on a small set of SEP-curated goals from the Goal Library.

Team projects

Live Coding

Lectures

 

Phase 4: Apprenticeship

Focus on building complex live applications on a team alongside experienced software developers.

Opportunity to work on multi-week projects.

Live Coding

Direct collaboration with SEPs

 

Phase 5: Career Prep

Development of job search assets \(resumes, cover letters, online presence, portfolio\)

Mock Interviews

Career development workshops 

 

Is someone responsible for ‘running’ each phase?

An SEP is assigned to each phase. Foundations 1 and 2 also have assigned pro-coaches. 

 

Do learners have to complete a phase in a specific amount of time?

Yes. Learners are strongly encouraged to complete phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in 6 weeks each, but have up to 8 weeks to successfully complete each phase. By week 8, the learner must be in the process of completing their Phase Interview, or have already completed it. 

 

How do learners advance from one phase to another?

The Guild requires learners to participate in a coding challenge and technical comprehension interview to advance from one phase to another. Together, we call the coding challenge and technical comprehension interview, a Phase Interview. See Phase Interviews section for more details.  

 

Are unused weeks in a phase rolled over if a learner interviews out of a phase early?

No, not exactly. If a learner moves into phases 2, 3, or 4 early, the weeks they did not spend in the previous phase may be added to their time in the Apprenticeship and Career Prep phases, rather than added to the phase they’re entering. Ultimately, you will still have up to 40 weeks in the program, however, the distribution of weeks per phase depends upon whether a learner uses 8 full weeks to advance through each of the first three phases \(totaling 24 weeks\). 

 

Can learners return to a previous phase after they’ve moved on? 

No. If a learner successfully interviews into the next phase, they cannot return to a previous phase.

 

 

Will there be stats in the upgraded model?

No, we’re done with stats and the game. Learning progress will be reflected to learners via phase interviews and periodic feedback from SEPs and pro-coaches. 

 

Is learner coaching still required? 

No, not formally. We encourage learners to work together and skillshare often and generously, but learners are not required to coach for 6 weeks while at the Guild. 

 

PHASE INTERVIEWS

What’s a Phase Interview?

Phase Interviews enable learners to move from one phase to another. We expect most learners to interview in their 6th week of the phase, but must interview no later than the 8th week of their time in phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3. 

 

Each phase interview has two parts: a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview with an SEP. Learners have 2.5 days to complete the coding challenge portion of the interview.

Phase 2 Interview = moving out of Phase 1 into Phase 2 

Phase 3 Interview = moving out of Phase 2 into Phase 3

Phase 4 Interview = moving out of Phase 3 into Phase 4

 

Acceptance into a new phase on or before week 8 of the current phase is a condition for maintaining membership at the Guild. Failing to be accepted into a new phase by week 8 of the current phase results in membership cancellation. See Membership section for more details. 

 

Why call them “interviews”...aren’t they really just “tests”?

Sure, in a way. But, so are job interviews. Our hope is that these coding challenges and comprehension interviews create scaffolds that will better prepare learners for the interview process they’ll ultimately encounter at the end of their time in the program. 

 

What is the coding challenge and how does it work?

The coding challenge simulates a skill-level appropriate “take home challenge,” similar to what developers encounter in many job interview processes. It gives learners an opportunity to demonstrate skills gained in a phase and readiness to begin a new phase. Depending on the phase a learner is interviewing into, the coding challenge may require them to complete exercises, build a small app, or build a full-stack application. 

 

What support and resources can be used for the coding challenge?

Phase Interviews must be completed solo. Learners are welcome to use online resources, books, and previous code they’ve written to complete the coding challenge. SEPs and Coaches provide limited support while learners work on coding challenges. They are available to support learners in understanding the specs or asking clarifying questions about the challenge. 

 

 

What is the technical comprehension interview and how does it work?

The technical comprehension interview is a 1-on-1 conversation with an SEP designed to evaluate learner understanding of the solutions they came up with on the coding challenge.   Each learner will meet with an interviewer via video chat for about 30 minutes to dig in to various parts of the submitted code. 

 

What counts as a successful Phase Interview?

Learners who complete and understand 80% or more of the content covered in their phase interview will be accepted into the phase for which they’re interviewing. 

 

How many times can a learner take a Phase Interview?

Learners may attempt a phase interview twice within the eight-week time period.

 

What happens if a learner has an unsuccessful Phase Interview?

It depends on when they take it. The first three phases are designed for learners to complete all modules in five weeks, and take the phase interview in the sixth week. If xa learner has an unsuccessful interview in the sixth week, they have one week to review and will be required to take it again in their eighth week. If the second interview is also unsuccessful, the learner’s membership will be canceled. 

 

Are learners required to take the Phase Interview twice?

No, there is no requirement to take it twice. Learners have the option of taking the phase interview twice during the 8 week period. If a learner thinks they’re ready to interview out of a phase early they are welcome to request a phase interview. If they are successful they’re welcome to move onto the next phase. 

 

Will I be asked to leave the Guild if I have two unsuccessful Phase Interviews?

Yes. Two unsuccessful attempts at entering a new phase results in membership cancellation. 

 



PHASE CURRICULUM

How do learners access the curriculum for each phase?

Visit the curriculum repo: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum. If you are not able to access it, ask an SEP to add you.

 

Will phase content always be the same?

Expect updates and adjustments as the SEPs see fit. 

 

Will learners still vote on goals in the new phases?

Learners are only required to vote on goals in the Integrated Practice phase which focuses on project-based learning in teams. 

 

Are learners still using the goal library?

Yes, but in limited form and only for the Integrated Practice phase. 

 

Are learners still required to submit a retrospective at the end of the week?

Learners in phases 3 and 4 will submit weekly retrospectives. These retros will be modified from their current form, since we’re no longer tracking game-related data like contribution %. 

 

Will lectures and other SEP delivered content be recorded?

Eventually, yes. The Guild intends on making SEP delivered content available asynchronously and is slowly ramping up to do so. 

 

Are there teams in the upgraded model?

Yes, we still have teams. Pairing is an important part of software engineering. Learners begin formally working in pairs in the Integrated Practice phase, but are encouraged to collaborate in any way that supports their learning, and may choose to pair in earlier phases at their own discretion. 

 

 

 



LEARNING SUPPORT

What will support look like in each phase?

A mix of various learning supports including SEP lectures, live coding, code reviews, cognitive apprenticeship are offered depending on the learning phase. Overall, the program is designed to provide more structure and scaffolding in the earlier phases, and greater agency in later phases. Each phase has an assigned SEP serving as the technical “point person” for the duration of a learner’s time in the phase. The earlier phases also have assigned pro-coaches.

Are we still using the Matrix?

Yes, but it will be upgraded to align with the skills covered in each phase. Upgrade release TBD.

 

Where can learners find out who the primary SEP is for their phase?

The Guild will announce SEP phase assignments on June 21st. Thereafter, learners can check the Slack channel for their phase to see which SEP is assigned to their group. 

 

Will we still use coach queue to get help?

No.

 

Will there still be houses and PSGs?

Yes. Learners will still join houses and houses will still meet every other week. The only change is that PSG is now called “xxx” - but it’s the same meeting. 

 

Are there any changes or updates to the COS? 

No, not at the moment. 

 

Is counseling still available?

Yep.

 

Is there support for finding a job in the last phase?

Yep. We’re hiring someone to provide additional support with job placements and career coaching. The position is open - If you know anyone great, send them here to learn more about the role and apply. 

 

Are you going to hire more SEPs?

We are actively recruiting additional SEPs.  In addition, we are offering a $1,500 incentive for any learner who refers a candidate for this position that ultimately gets hired as a full-time SEP for us. Please refer anyone to apply here, and have them mention your name in their cover letter. 

 

SCHEDULING & SPACE

Is the weekly schedule changing now that we have phases?

Yes, weekly schedules will vary by Phase. Please check the Guild Calendar regularly throughout the week to find relevant meetings like lectures, code reviews, and COS workshops. All learners are required to be present for the following:  

 

Monday All-Hands

Daily Standup

Friday Wrap-up 

COS Workshops

 

Does each phase group work in a different part of the Guild? 

Yes, each phase ideally has it’s own section of the Guild. Seating an entire phase group in one area enables assigned SEPs and pro-coaches to provide better support. Learners are welcome to change workstations within the assigned area, but may not change areas until they’ve changed phases. We’ll do our best to make this happen, but depending on how many learners are distributed across the phases, this may not work perfectly. Stay tuned. 

Phase 1 & 2 sit on the light side

Phase 3, 4, & 5 sit on the dark side

 

What’s the best way to communicate with other learners working on the same problems?

Each phase has a Phase Channel in Slack and will be seated together, making IRL conversations easy.  

 



MEMBERSHIP

Does the 6-week membership extension offered a few months ago still apply?

No, the 6-week offer has been superseded by the additional time a learner may receive as a result of the sorting interview. 

 

How is Guild Membership determined in the upgraded model?

A learner maintains membership in the Guild by successfully advancing through the learning phases on time and staying in compliance with overall membership expectations and policies. Failure to advance to the next learning phase on time results in membership cancellation. Failure to comply with membership expectations and policies can also result in potential membership cancellation. The Guide will reflect the most updated Membership Expectations by July 1. 

 

Does the Guild still grant learners personal and professional development days?

The time off system will remain the same in the upgraded model. The number of personal and professional development days you have remaining will still apply for the duration of your time at the Guild. We may adjust this to account for learners having more time in the program.  

 

What happens to my ISAs if my membership is canceled? What happens to my ISAs if I choose to leave the Guild?

For those who do not advance beyond their first assigned phase, or who choose to leave the Guild before August 18, the final pricing of their tuition ISA will be based on the number of weeks they have been at the Guild \(under both v1.0 and v1.5\) applied to the new pricing model rounded down to the previous time period total. 

 

For those who continue on at the Guild past August 18, their final price will be based on the new pricing model for the amount of time they have been at the Guild \(under both v1.0 and v1.5\), rounding up for the time period once they have completed 60% of that time period.

 

Is the contract and/or rebate changing at all?

There are no updates on additional contract changes at this time.

No, we’re done with stats and the game. Learning progress will be reflected to learners via phase interviews and periodic feedback from SEPs and pro-coaches. 

 

Is learner coaching still required? 

No, not formally. We encourage learners to work together and skillshare often and generously, but learners are not required to coach for 6 weeks while at the Guild. 

 

PHASE INTERVIEWS

What’s a Phase Interview?

Phase Interviews enable learners to move from one phase to another. We expect most learners to interview in their 6th week of the phase, but must interview no later than the 8th week of their time in phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3. 

 

Each phase interview has two parts: a coding challenge and a technical comprehension interview with an SEP. Learners have 2.5 days to complete the coding challenge portion of the interview.

Phase 2 Interview = moving out of Phase 1 into Phase 2 

Phase 3 Interview = moving out of Phase 2 into Phase 3

Phase 4 Interview = moving out of Phase 3 into Phase 4

 

Acceptance into a new phase on or before week 8 of the current phase is a condition for maintaining membership at the Guild. Failing to be accepted into a new phase by week 8 of the current phase results in membership cancellation. See Membership section for more details. 

 

Why call them “interviews”...aren’t they really just “tests”?

Sure, in a way. But, so are job interviews. Our hope is that these coding challenges and comprehension interviews create scaffolds that will better prepare learners for the interview process they’ll ultimately encounter at the end of their time in the program. 

 

What is the coding challenge and how does it work?

The coding challenge simulates a skill-level appropriate “take home challenge,” similar to what developers encounter in many job interview processes. It gives learners an opportunity to demonstrate skills gained in a phase and readiness to begin a new phase. Depending on the phase a learner is interviewing into, the coding challenge may require them to complete exercises, build a small app, or build a full-stack application. 

 

What support and resources can be used for the coding challenge?

Phase Interviews must be completed solo. Learners are welcome to use online resources, books, and previous code they’ve written to complete the coding challenge. SEPs and Coaches provide limited support while learners work on coding challenges. They are available to support learners in understanding the specs or asking clarifying questions about the challenge. 

 

 

What is the technical comprehension interview and how does it work?

The technical comprehension interview is a 1-on-1 conversation with an SEP designed to evaluate learner understanding of the solutions they came up with on the coding challenge.   Each learner will meet with an interviewer via video chat for about 30 minutes to dig in to various parts of the submitted code. 

 

What counts as a successful Phase Interview?

Learners who complete and understand 80% or more of the content covered in their phase interview will be accepted into the phase for which they’re interviewing. 

 

How many times can a learner take a Phase Interview?

Learners may attempt a phase interview twice within the eight-week time period.

 

What happens if a learner has an unsuccessful Phase Interview?

It depends on when they take it. The first three phases are designed for learners to complete all modules in five weeks, and take the phase interview in the sixth week. If xa learner has an unsuccessful interview in the sixth week, they have one week to review and will be required to take it again in their eighth week. If the second interview is also unsuccessful, the learner’s membership will be canceled. 

 

Are learners required to take the Phase Interview twice?

No, there is no requirement to take it twice. Learners have the option of taking the phase interview twice during the 8 week period. If a learner thinks they’re ready to interview out of a phase early they are welcome to request a phase interview. If they are successful they’re welcome to move onto the next phase. 

 

Will I be asked to leave the Guild if I have two unsuccessful Phase Interviews?

Yes. Two unsuccessful attempts at entering a new phase results in membership cancellation. 

 



PHASE CURRICULUM

How do learners access the curriculum for each phase?

Visit the curriculum repo: https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum. If you are not able to access it, ask an SEP to add you.

 

Will phase content always be the same?

Expect updates and adjustments as the SEPs see fit. 

 

Will learners still vote on goals in the new phases?

Learners are only required to vote on goals in the Integrated Practice phase which focuses on project-based learning in teams. 

 

Are learners still using the goal library?

Yes, but in limited form and only for the Integrated Practice phase. 

 

Are learners still required to submit a retrospective at the end of the week?

Learners in phases 3 and 4 will submit weekly retrospectives. These retros will be modified from their current form, since we’re no longer tracking game-related data like contribution %. 

 

Will lectures and other SEP delivered content be recorded?

Eventually, yes. The Guild intends on making SEP delivered content available asynchronously and is slowly ramping up to do so. 

 

Are there teams in the upgraded model?

Yes, we still have teams. Pairing is an important part of software engineering. Learners begin formally working in pairs in the Integrated Practice phase, but are encouraged to collaborate in any way that supports their learning, and may choose to pair in earlier phases at their own discretion. 

 

 

 



LEARNING SUPPORT

What will support look like in each phase?

A mix of various learning supports including SEP lectures, live coding, code reviews, cognitive apprenticeship are offered depending on the learning phase. Overall, the program is designed to provide more structure and scaffolding in the earlier phases, and greater agency in later phases. Each phase has an assigned SEP serving as the technical “point person” for the duration of a learner’s time in the phase. The earlier phases also have assigned pro-coaches.

Are we still using the Matrix?

Yes, but it will be upgraded to align with the skills covered in each phase. Upgrade release TBD.

 

Where can learners find out who the primary SEP is for their phase?

The Guild will announce SEP phase assignments on June 21st. Thereafter, learners can check the Slack channel for their phase to see which SEP is assigned to their group. 

 

Will we still use coach queue to get help?

No.

 

Will there still be houses and PSGs?

Yes. Learners will still join houses and houses will still meet every other week. The only change is that PSG is now called “xxx” - but it’s the same meeting. 

 

Are there any changes or updates to the COS? 

No, not at the moment. 

 

Is counseling still available?

Yep.

 

Is there support for finding a job in the last phase?

Yep. We’re hiring someone to provide additional support with job placements and career coaching. The position is open - If you know anyone great, send them here to learn more about the role and apply. 

 

Are you going to hire more SEPs?

We are actively recruiting additional SEPs.  In addition, we are offering a $1,500 incentive for any learner who refers a candidate for this position that ultimately gets hired as a full-time SEP for us. Please refer anyone to apply here, and have them mention your name in their cover letter. 

 

SCHEDULING & SPACE

Is the weekly schedule changing now that we have phases?

Yes, weekly schedules will vary by Phase. Please check the Guild Calendar regularly throughout the week to find relevant meetings like lectures, code reviews, and COS workshops. All learners are required to be present for the following:  

 

Monday All-Hands

Daily Standup

Friday Wrap-up 

COS Workshops

 

Does each phase group work in a different part of the Guild? 

Yes, each phase ideally has it’s own section of the Guild. Seating an entire phase group in one area enables assigned SEPs and pro-coaches to provide better support. Learners are welcome to change workstations within the assigned area, but may not change areas until they’ve changed phases. We’ll do our best to make this happen, but depending on how many learners are distributed across the phases, this may not work perfectly. Stay tuned. 

Phase 1 & 2 sit on the light side

Phase 3, 4, & 5 sit on the dark side

 

What’s the best way to communicate with other learners working on the same problems?

Each phase has a Phase Channel in Slack and will be seated together, making IRL conversations easy.  

 



MEMBERSHIP

Does the 6-week membership extension offered a few months ago still apply?

No, the 6-week offer has been superseded by the additional time a learner may receive as a result of the sorting interview. 

 

How is Guild Membership determined in the upgraded model?

A learner maintains membership in the Guild by successfully advancing through the learning phases on time and staying in compliance with overall membership expectations and policies. Failure to advance to the next learning phase on time results in membership cancellation. Failure to comply with membership expectations and policies can also result in potential membership cancellation. The Guide will reflect the most updated Membership Expectations by July 1. 

 

Does the Guild still grant learners personal and professional development days?

The time off system will remain the same in the upgraded model. The number of personal and professional development days you have remaining will still apply for the duration of your time at the Guild. We may adjust this to account for learners having more time in the program.  

 

What happens to my ISAs if my membership is canceled? What happens to my ISAs if I choose to leave the Guild?

For those who do not advance beyond their first assigned phase, or who choose to leave the Guild before August 18, the final pricing of their tuition ISA will be based on the number of weeks they have been at the Guild \(under both v1.0 and v1.5\) applied to the new pricing model rounded down to the previous time period total.
