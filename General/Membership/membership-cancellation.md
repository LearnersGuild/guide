# **Membership Termination**

Sometimes, things just don't work out the way we thought they would. As such, there are a couple of ways Learners leave the Guild. In this section you will find information on Guild-initiated Membership Termination and the conditions under which the Guild may ask a Learner to leave. 

You will also find information about how you can cancel your membership during the official cancellation period, as well as information about initiating your withdrawal from the program _after_ the cancellation period has passed.
