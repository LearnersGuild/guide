### **Membership Cancellation**

The terms of your membership at the Guild are specified in your Enrollment Agreement. The terms of your financial agreement with the Guild is specified in your ISA contract. If at some point in your time at the Guild you decide to withdraw from the program, you may begin that process by contacting your Learning Facilitator. All financial obligations as specified in the ISA will apply.

There are a few scenarios in which your membership can be cancelled by the Guild.

* Failure to meet the six Membership Expectations outlined above results in the termination of our investment and cancellation of your membership.

  * _**In particular, and without exception, failure to be accepted into a new phase by week \(8\) eight of the current phase results in membership cancellation.**_

* Failure to uphold Guild culture can result in membership cancellation.
