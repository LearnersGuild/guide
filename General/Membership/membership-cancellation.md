# **Membership Termination**

The terms of your membership in the Guild are governed by your Enrollment Agreement, which incorporates this guide. The terms of your financial agreement with the Guild are specified in the Enrollment Agreement and Income Share Agreement \(ISA\), if applicable. If you decide to withdraw from the program after the stated cancellation period \(see below for more information on the **Learner Cancellation Policy**\) some point in your time at the Guild, you may begin that process by contacting your Learning Facilitator. All financial obligations as specified in the ISA will apply.

**Learners Guild reserves the right to terminate your membership in the Guild as set forth in your Enrollment Agreement, and including under the following cimcumstances:**

* Failure to meet the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md)** **outlined above can result in the termination of our investment and cancellation of your membership.

  * _**In particular, failure to be accepted into phases 2, 3 or 4 by week \(8\) eight of the current phase may immediately result in membership termination.**_

* 5 consecutive days of non-participation in the program without communicating with the staff. See the **No call, No Show **section of the [**Time Commitment**](//Policies/Time_Commitment.md) policy in the Guide.

* Failure to uphold Learners Guild's culture. In particular,

  * Being out of integrity with the non-technical membership expectations \(Attendance and Community Expectations\) as set forth in the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section of this Guide.

For purposes of clarity, termination of your membership in the Guild as referenced in this Guide is the same as the termination of your participation in the Program, as referenced in your Enrollment Agreement.

## **Guild Policies Overview**

We have a handful of policies and they're applicable chapter-wide. Our policies are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. Guild members must abide by all of the policies in the Guide as a condition for continued membership. You can read all Guild policies below in the [Guild Policies Section](/Policies/README.md).
