# Transition Guide 

Sometimes things just don't work out the way we planned. As such, there are a couple of ways Learners leave the Guild. In this section you will find information on [**Guild-Initiated Membership Termination**](/General/Membership/guild-initiated-membership-termination.md) and the conditions under which the Guild may ask a Learner to leave.

You will also find information on [**How to Leave the Guild**](/General/Membership/learner-initiated-membership-cancelation-period.md)** **both during the official cancellation period, and after that period has passed.
