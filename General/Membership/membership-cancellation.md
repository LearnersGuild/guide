# Transition Guide

As mentioned above, when you are accepted to Learners Guild, you join our ever-growing community of Members \(Learners and Alums\). However there are some instances in which continuing in the program, or continuing membership with the Guild is not viable for various reasons. This Transition Guide outlines the conditions under which program participation and/or membership is terminated, either by the Learner or by the Guild.

### Membership Termination

There are only two instances in which _**Membership**_ is terminated, rather than simply transitioning from an active [Learner](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#learner) to a [Guild Alum](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#alum).

###### Scenario 1:

If you decide to withdraw, or are asked to leave the Guild, during the first 5 weeks of the program, also referred to as the [**Membership Cancellation Period**](/ https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#membership-cancellation-period),** **your membership with the Guild is effectively terminated. As such, you will no longer have access to the membership benefits offered to Learners and Alums. 

###### Scenario 2:

If you are in serious violation of any of the [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md) the Guild reserves the right to revoke your Membership. This is equally applicable to active Learners and Alums.
