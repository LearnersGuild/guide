### **Membership Termination**

The terms of your membership in the Guild are governed by your Enrollment Agreement, which incorporates this guide. The terms of your financial agreement with the Guild are specified in the Enrollment Agreement and Income Share Agreement \(ISA\), if applicable. If at some point in your time at the Guild you decide to withdraw from the program, you may begin that process by contacting your Learning Facilitator. All financial obligations as specified in the ISA will apply.

The Guild reserves the right to terminate your membership in the Guild as set forth in your Enrollment Agreement, including under the following scenarios:

* Failure to meet the six Membership Expectations outlined above results in the termination of our investment and cancellation of your membership.

  * _**In particular, and without exception, failure to be accepted into a new phase by week \(8\) eight of the current phase results in membership cancellation.**_

* Failure to uphold Guild culture.

* Noncompliance with Guild policies.

For purposes of clarity, termination of your membership in the Guild as referenced in this Guide is the same as the termination of your participation in the Program, as referenced in your Enrollment Agreement.

#### **Guild Policies Overview**

We have a handful of policies and they're applicable chapter-wide. Our policies are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. Guild members must abide by all of the policies in the Guide as a condition for continued membership. You can read all Guild policies below in the [Guild Policies Section](/Policies/README.md).
