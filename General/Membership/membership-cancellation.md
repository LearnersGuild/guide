# Transition Guide

As mentioned above, when you are accepted to Learners Guild, you join our ever-growing community of Members \(Learners and Alums\). If you stay in the program beyond your 5th week, your Guild Membership stays with you for as long as our doors are open. There are only two instances where _**Membership**_ is terminated, rather than simply transitioning from an active [Learner](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#learner) to a [Guild Alum](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#alum).

### Membership Termination

###### Scenario 1:

If you decide to withdraw, or are asked to leave the Guild, during the first 5 weeks of the program, also referred to as the [**Membership Cancellation Period**](/ https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#membership-cancellation-period),** **your membership with the Guild is effectively terminated. 

###### Scenario 2:

If you are in serious violation of any of the [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md) the Guild reserves the right to revoke your Membership. This is equally applicable to active Learners and Alums.
