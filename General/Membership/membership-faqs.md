# Membership & Financial FAQs

#### How is Guild Membership determined?

A learner maintains membership in the Guild by successfully advancing through the learning phases on time and staying in compliance with overall membership expectations and policies. Failure to advance to the next learning phase on time results in membership cancellation. Failure to comply with membership expectations and policies can also result in potential membership cancellation.

#### What happens to my ISAs if my membership is terminated or if I choose to leave the Guild?

If your membership is terminated before your anticipated graduation date, you are responsible for ISA repayments consistent with the payback period indicated in your ISA contract, and the income share percentage attached to the session in which your membership was terminated.

#### What is the time commitment?

See the [Time Commitment](../Policies/Time_Commitment.md) page.

#### **Can I leave and join a later cohort if it turns out the timing isn't good for me?**

If you withdraw from the Guild for any reason you must reapply to be considered for an upcoming cohort.

#### What if I change my mind after I sign this contract?

By signing this contract, you're letting us know you are certain about your commitment to Learners Guild. If you change your mind after signing the contract and choose not to join the program, we cannot offer your spot to another learner for that start date. While we don't ask for a deposit, there will be a $250 cancellation fee if you sign a contract and decide not to join the Guild within 3 weeks of your start date. Please carefully consider your decision, and sign only when you are a joyful and confident "yes". If you need to seek the opinion of a trusted third party, we highly encourage you to do so.

#### What's required? What's optional?

Please see the [Membership Expectations](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section to read all non-negotiable requirements for Learners. But, the short of the long is you are required to participate fully in the structure of the program by:

* Diligently work on the curriculum for your phase.  
* Abiding by the pacing requirements.

* Dedicating yourself to your work and your team \(if you have one\) for the week.

* Completing retrospectives \(if you have one\), offer feedback \(if you had a pair partner\) and participate in reflection Fridays.

* Attending daily announcments, daily standups, weekly House Meetings, and COS Workshops.

* Observing and adhering to [Guild Policies](//Policies/README.md).

You may choose to revisit COS Workshops that support goals you have for yourself or address feedback you're receiving from peers, practitioners, or facilitators.

#### What if I can't get hired after the Guild?

Keep learning, studying, building software and applying for jobs. All Guild graduates have access to online Guild resources and may take advantage of Phase 5 Career Prep resources for 36 months following graduation. 

#### What if I change my mind and don't want to be a web developer?

We would be sorry to hear that, but of course it is your choice. If you realize web development, and Learners Guild, is not for you, you are still obligated to the repayment terms indicated in the ISA agreement. If you have doubts about pursuing this career before joining a Guild chapter, we strongly recommend not matriculating in the program. Our business depends on your commitment to becoming a web developer, so if you're unsure, you should take the time to get clear before joining the program.

#### What if I want to found a startup after I finish at the Guild?

Our business model depends on our learners "paying it forward" - in other words, it depends on our learners repaying the Guild through their Income Sharing Agreement during their first three \(3\) years of employment. Startup life can be unpredictable, so in order for us to continue offering the program with no upfront costs, it's imperative that graduated learners are in a position to repay their ISA. If you plan to start your own company, please elect to pay our program fees upfront.

#### What if I'm not making more than $50,000 per year?

Income sharing only applies if your income is more than $50,000 annually, including income from self-employment or consulting work. In certain cases, gains from equity that you received as a result of your work for a company also counts as 'income'. Please see the Income Share Agreement for more details. +

#### What if I get fired from my first job or decide to quit?

If you're unemployed, and your income is less than $50,000, the Income Sharing Agreement is paused until you're making at least $50,000.
