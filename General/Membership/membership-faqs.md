# Membership FAQs

#### How is Guild Membership determined?

A learner maintains membership in the Guild by successfully advancing through the learning phases on time and staying in compliance with overall membership expectations and policies. Failure to advance to the next learning phase on time results in membership cancellation. Failure to comply with membership expectations and policies can also result in potential membership cancellation. The Guide will reflect the most updated Membership Expectations by July 1.

#### What happens to my ISAs if my membership is terminated or if I choose to leave the Guild?

If your membership is terminated before your anticipated graduation date, you are responsible for ISA repayments consistent with the payback period indicated in your ISA contract, and the income share percentage attached to the session in which your membership was terminated.

#### What is the time commitment?

See the [Time Commitment](../Policies/Time_Commitment.md) page.

#### **Can I re-join a later cohort if it turns out the timing isn't good for me?**

#### What if I change my mind after I sign this contract?

By signing this contract, you're letting us know you are certain about your commitment to Learners Guild. If you change your mind after signing the contract and choose not to join the program, we cannot offer your spot to another learner for that start date. While we don't ask for a deposit, there will be a $250 cancellation fee if you sign a contract and decide not to join the Guild within 3 weeks of your start date. Please carefully consider your decision, and sign only when you are a joyful and confident "yes". If you need to seek the opinion of a trusted third party, we highly encourage you to do so.

#### What's required? What's optional?

Please see the [Membership Expectations](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section to read all non-negotiable requirements for Learners. But, the short of the long is you are required to participate fully in the structure of the program by:

* Diligently work on the curriculum for your phase.  
* Abide by the pacing requirements.

* Dedicate yourself to your work and your team \(if you have one\) for the week.

* Complete retrospectives \(if you have one\), offer feedback \(if you had a pair partner\) and participate in reflection Fridays.

* Attend daily announcments, daily standups, weekly House Meetings, and COS Workshops.

* Observe and adhere to [Guild Policies](//Policies/README.md).

You may choose to revisit COS Workshops that support goals you have for yourself or address feedback you're receiving from peers, practitioners, or facilitators.
