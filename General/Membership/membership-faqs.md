# Membership & Financial FAQs

#### How is Guild Membership determined?

A learner maintains membership in the Guild by successfully advancing through the learning phases on time and staying in compliance with overall membership expectations and policies. Failure to advance to the next learning phase on time results in membership cancellation. Failure to comply with membership expectations and policies can also result in potential membership cancellation.

#### Is there a cancellation period?

Yes. Your first five weeks are a bit of a test drive - for you and for us. We want to ensure you will thrive in the Guild's learning environment so during your first five \(5\) weeks we invite you to work hard, test the model, and assess whether or not the Guild is a good fit for you. You have up to week five to cancel your membership without financial obligations if you conclude the Guild is not the right learning environment for you. During week five all new Learners are required to take a coding challenge and technical interview - it's our way of determining how well you're learning in our model and whether or not we will continue to invest in you. **We will cancel your membership if the outcome of your coding challenge indicates the Guild is not the right learning environment for you.**

#### **Can I leave and join a later cohort if the timing isn't good for me?**

We make selections carefully and cannot guarantee you a spot at another time. If you withdraw from the Guild you must reapply to be considered for an upcoming cohort.

#### What happens to my ISAs if my membership is terminated or if I choose to leave the Guild?

If your membership is terminated before your anticipated graduation date, you are responsible for ISA repayments consistent with the payback period indicated in your ISA contract, and the income share percentage attached to the session in which your membership was terminated.

#### What if I realize I don't want to be a web developer?

We would be sorry to hear that, but of course it is your choice. If you realize web development, and Learners Guild, is not for you, you are still obligated to the repayment terms indicated in the ISA agreement. If you have doubts about pursuing this career before joining a Guild chapter, we strongly recommend not matriculating in the program. Our business depends on your commitment to becoming a web developer, so if you're unsure, you should take the time to get clear before joining the program.

#### What's required? What's optional?

Please see the [Membership Expectations](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section to read all non-negotiable requirements for Learners. But, the short of the long is you are required to participate fully in the structure of the program by:

* Diligently work on the curriculum for your phase.  
* Abiding by the pacing requirements.

* Dedicating yourself to your work and your team \(if you have one\) for the week.

* Completing retrospectives \(if you have one\), offer feedback \(if you had a pair partner\) and participate in reflection Fridays.

* Attending daily announcments, daily standups, weekly House Meetings, and COS Workshops.

* Observing and adhering to [Guild Policies](//Policies/README.md).

You may choose to revisit COS Workshops that support goals you have for yourself or address feedback you're receiving from peers, SEPs, or facilitators.

#### What is the time commitment?

See the [Time Commitment](../Policies/Time_Commitment.md) page.

#### Do we get time off?

Yes, we observe all national holidays. Check the [Holiday List](//General/Holiday_List.md) for Guild closure dates. We also take one week off for the winter holiday season/new year's, and another week off during the summer. Depending on when you're at the Guild, you may have one, or both of those weeks off. Every Learner also has ten \(10\) personal days and three \(3\) professional development days to use over the course of their 40 weeks. See the [Time Commitment ](//Policies/Time_Commitment.md)section for more details.

#### What if I can't get hired after the Guild?

Keep learning, studying, building software and applying for jobs. All Guild graduates have access to online Guild resources and may take advantage of Phase 5 Career Prep resources for 36 months following graduation.

#### What if I want to found a startup after I finish at the Guild?

Our business model depends on our learners "paying it forward" - in other words, it depends on our learners repaying the Guild through their Income Sharing Agreement during their first three \(3\) years of employment. Startup life can be unpredictable, so in order for us to continue offering the program with no upfront costs, it's imperative that graduated learners are in a position to repay their ISA. If you plan to start your own company, please elect to pay our program fees upfront.

#### What if I'm not making more than $50,000 per year?

Income sharing only applies if your income is more than $50,000 annually, including income from self-employment or consulting work. In certain cases, gains from equity that you received as a result of your work for a company also counts as 'income'. Please see the Income Share Agreement for more details.

#### What if I get fired from my first job or decide to quit?

If you're unemployed, and your income is less than $50,000, the Income Sharing Agreement is paused until you're making at least $50,000.

#### When do I have to start repaying my ISA?

Learners are afforded a three-month grace period after they complete or withdraw from the Guild before payments are required.

#### Do I need my own computer?

Yes, you need to have a Mac laptop that's less than 3 years old. Everyone at Learners Guild uses a Mac, so it will be easier for you to collaborate with others and get troubleshooting support from our staff. Visit the [Qualified Laptop](/Runway/qualified-laptop.md) page for more information. 

#### What platforms and operating systems does Learners Guild use?

Apple computers running the latest Mac OS. If you are used to a Windows or Linux environment, there will be a learning curve, but it is worth it. Being able to use a Mac well is a useful skill in this field.

#### What if I have a conflict with someone that I can't resolve on my own?

Conflicts happen. It's natural. And in most cases working through conflicts with our colleagues only serves to improve our relationships and the working environment. Our intention is to empower you to resolve interpersonal conflicts you may have with others by using the interpersonal tools we share in the [COS](https://cos.learnersguild.org/Practice_Tending_Relationship/Requests.html). If the conflict is tenacious, there is a [formal conflict resolution ](https://cos.learnersguild.org/Practice_Tending_Relationship/Conflict.html)process in place to support you in resolving it.

#### Is there a dress code?

Casual, but professional. As in, we want you to be comfortable and that looks different ways to different people. So feel free to be in the full expression of your personal style, but consider leaving the pj's at home.
