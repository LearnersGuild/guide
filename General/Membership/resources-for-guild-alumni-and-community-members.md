# Resources for Guild Alumni & Community Members

A Learner once said they were thinking of staying at the Guild forever and we get why. Learners Guild offers an unparalleled learning experience and an opportunity to build deeply transformative relationships. Our goal is to help you take all you've learned at the Guild out into the world; to take the web development and interpersonal skills you acquired with us into the next phase of your journey as a web developer. But just because everyone eventually transitions out of the Guild's physical space doesn't mean the Guild community, or the reasouces provided there, have to come to an end right away. Below you'll find information about different resources available to Guild Alumni and Community Members. But first, a little detour into what those terms actually mean.

##### Learners Guild Alumni

A Guild Alumni is any Learner who completes the program or leaves the program early to accept a technical position.

##### Learner Guild Community Members

A Guild Community Member is any learner who attends a portion of the program and leaves early, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, or for a reason other than to accept a technical position.

### Resources available to Guild Alums

As you exit the Guild, we want to make sure you know what supports are available to you and what to expect from your "off-boarding." As alumni, you have access to most of the same resources. You are, however, responsible for making sure that your use of resources does _not _limit access for currently active learners.

### Examples of Available Resources {#marked-examples-of-available-resources}

* Echo & curriculum: you can still sign into Echo and curriculum and access the materials there.
* Alumni Slack instance: you will be added to the special alumni-only Slack so you can stay in touch with all graduated Guild members.
* Videos of lectures, live coding, cog-apps, etc. are accessible on the Learners Guild YouTube channel.
* Join in on live video lectures: you can join into scheduled lectures via video chat, but please be prioritize currently active learners' questions and learning.
* Use of office space: feel free to work out of the Learners Guild office. While you are here, please respect the space and always ensure that you're not disrupting or blocking currently active learners from their work \(e.g. keep the noise level down, don't take up workstation space if it is limited, be helpful and courteous\).

### Examples of Unavailable/Restricted Resources {#marked-examples-of-unavailable-restricted-resources}

* You will no longer have access to Guild-provided accounts for external sites like Treehouse and FrontEnd Masters. We need to reserve these licenses for currently active learners.
* You will no longer have access to all channels of the main Learners Guild Slack instance.
* You will no longer have direct access to Coaches and SEPs during Guild hours. They need to focus on supporting currently active learners. This doesn't mean you can't ask questions of them in the alumni Slack, but during Guild hours they need to focus on supporting currently active learners.
