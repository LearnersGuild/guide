# Resources for Guild Alumni & Community Members

We know, it'd be great if you could just chill at the Guild forever, but the truth is you came to acquire web development skills and one day you'll set off to use those skills in a job that you worked hard to land. It might also be true that you spent time at the Guild and decided to switch it up and leave the program early to pursue other goals. Either way, all Learners who work with us are a part of our community and we intend to keep it that way. Below you'll find information about different resources available to Guild Alumni and Community Members. But first, a little detour into what those terms actually mean. 

##### Learners Guild Alumni
