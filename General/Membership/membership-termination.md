# Membership Termination

There are only two instances in which _**Membership**_ is terminated, rather than simply transitioning from an active [Learner](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#learner) to a [Guild Alum](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#alum).

###### Scenario 1:

If you decide to withdraw, or are asked to leave the Guild _**during the first 5 weeks of the program**_, also referred to as the [**Membership Cancellation Period**](/ https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#membership-cancellation-period),** **your membership with the Guild is effectively terminated. As such, you will no longer have access to the [Membership Benefits](//General/Membership.md) offered to Learners and Alums.

###### Scenario 2:

If you are in serious violation of any of the [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md) the Guild reserves the right to revoke your Membership. This is equally applicable to active Learners and Alums.
