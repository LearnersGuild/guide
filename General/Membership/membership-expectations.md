# Learner Expectations

### _All actively enrolled Learners are required to meet the following expectations:_

#### Learning Expectations

1. **Compliance with Phase Interview Guidelines: **Advancing from one phase to another is contingent upon passing a phase interview. There are clear instructions and guidelines that all Guild Members are expected to adhere to in order to preserve the integrity of the interview and give us the clearest window into your progress as a developer. See the **Phase Interview** section for more information.
2. **Be on Purpose: **Your number one purpose at the Guild is to acquire the skills and mindsets that will make you competitive for junior web developer jobs. All Guild Members are expected to stay on track to land a high-paying job as a web developer and to fully participate in the program structure as offered. For example, you are expected to attend daily stand-up, or, if you're in the Practice phase you're actively participating in project work, or if you're in Foundations you're working on modules and attending lectures.
3. **Demonstrate a Growth Mindset:** Learning means weâ€™re becoming familiar with, and increasing our mastery over, a topic or skill that was unfamiliar before. Given that, there will be plenty times when you experience not knowing something in the technical or interpersonal arena, making an error, feeling anxious, experiencing some degree of failure, or hear hard feedback. All Learners are expected to respond to challenge and feedback with a growth mindset, that is, a belief that your abilities and intelligence can be changed or improved, and a willingness to grow.

#### Attendance Expectations

1. **Time Commitment: **
   1. Show up from **10a to 5p daily. **
   2. Periodically you may have a scheduled meeting between 5-6pm. 
   3. You may arrive as early as 7am to begin working. Optional content, such as Algonauts, begins at 9am. 
   4. You must be present for Phase Checkin at 10am, no exceptions.

   1. **Half Day Off**: If you will miss more than an hour of the day you must log a half day \(1-4 hours\),   
   2. **Full Day Off**: If you will miss more than four \(4\) hours, you must log a full day.

   **To maintain membership at the Guild you must not exceed 10 personal days, and 3 professional development days.**

3. **No Call, No Show: **Learners who fail to report** **five days of non-participation in the program are in violation of the Attendance Expectations which may result in the immediate termination of their membership. See the [**No Call, No Show** ](//Policies/Time_Commitment.md)section of the Time Commitment Policy for additional information.

If you're running late to a meeting, you are required to notify the people you are meeting with ahead of time.

**Please note that it is your responsibility to immediately consult with your Learning Facilitator and Phase Lead if extenuating circumstances or major life events unexpectedly prevent you from fulfilling the above time commitment on a regular basis.**

#### Community Expectations

1. **Guild Policy Compliance:** We have a handful of Guild-wide policies that are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. You are expected and required to read, understand and comply with all published [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md) and those that may be added in the future. Doing so is a condition for continued membership. You can read all Guild policies below in the [**Guild Policies Section**](/Policies/README.md)**. **
2. **Community Agreements:** The Guild is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone that facilitates accelerated learning, self-leadership development and transformative relationship building. In order to support a diverse community of learners we require all Guild members to abide by our [**Community Agreements**](/community-agreements.md)** **and** **those that may be added in the future. Check in with your Onboarding Mentor and/or Learning Facilitator if you have any questions.
