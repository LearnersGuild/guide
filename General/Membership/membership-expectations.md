# Membership Expectations

#### All enrolled learners are required to meet the following expectations:

1. **Time Commitment: **Show up from **9a to 6p daily**. If you're running late or leaving early, you’re required to alert your house and phase group in the appropriate slack  channels. 
2. **Time Off: **Each learner has 8 personal days, and 3 professional development days to use during their 40 weeks. You are required to log all time off with the Guild by emailing timeoff@learnersguild.org as soon as you know you will be out. If you will miss more than an hour of the day you must log a half day \(1-4 hours\), and if you will miss more than four \(4\) hours, you must log a full day. To maintain membership at the Guild you must not exceed 8 personal days, and 3 professional development days.
3. **Be Present at all Scheduled Meetings:** There are recurring meetings that all learners are required to attend, plus additional one-off meetings that may be put on your Google calendar, and/or on shared Guild calendars. You are obligated to be present for all scheduled meetings, including but not limited to, onboarding meetings, 1:1 meetings with staff, Monday All-Hands meetings, Daily Standups, Friday Wrap-ups, Learner Support Group Meetings, and COS Workshops. If you're running late to a meeting, you are required to notify the people you are meeting with ahead of time.
4. **Policy Compliance:** You are required to read, understand and comply with all published Guild Policies and those that may be added in the future. Make sure to thoroughly read the policies included at the end of this Guide. 
5. **Growth Mindset:** Learning means we’re becoming familiar with, and increasing our mastery over, a topic or skill that was unfamiliar before. Given that, there will be plenty times when you experience not knowing something, making an error, feeling anxious, experiencing some degree of failure, or hear hard feedback. All Guild members are expected to respond to challenge and feedback with a growth mindset, that is, a belief that your abilities and intelligence can be changed or improved.
6. **Be on Purpose: **Your number one purpose at the Guild is to acquire the skills and mindsets that will make you competitive for junior web developer jobs. All Guild members are expected to stay on track to land a high-paying job as a web developer. This means advancing into the phases at the required pace. _**Acceptance into a new phase on or before week \(8\) eight of the current phase is a condition for maintaining membership at the Guild. Failing to be accepted into a new phase by week \(8\) eight of the current phase may immediately result in membership termination.**_ See the [Learning Phase](//Phases/README.md) section for more information on Guild pacing requirements.
