# How to Leave the Program

### Program Participation & Membership Cancellation Period

During your first 5 weeks we expect and encourage you to intentionally explore whether the Guild is the right fit for you.** If during your first 5 weeks you decide you want to leave the Guild for any reason you may elect to cancel your Membership and end your program participation without any financial obligation to the Guild. Doing so also means ending your access to all Membership Benefits. **Consult your Enrollment Agreement to understand the full scope of the Cancellation and Refund process, then follow the steps outlined below to get the ball rolling.

### Post-Cancellation Period Program Withdrawal

If you'd like to withdraw from the program for whatever reason _after week 5_, you may initiate the withdrawal process by following the steps below. Unlike Program Participation and Membership Cancellation, withdrawing from the program after the 5 week cancellation period obligates you to payment as specified in your Enrollment Agreement and ISA agreement, if applicable. **In other words, if you withdraw from the Learners Guild Program after the 5 week cancellation period you will have a financial obligation to the Guild under the terms of your Enrollment Agreement and ISA Agreement.** Again, consult your Enrollment Agreement to understand the full financial implications of leaving the program after the cancellation period. 

_If you have a Guild Laptop, you must return it within 3 days of your last day in the program. Please make arrangements to return any other Guild property \(headphones, books, etc.\) within this timeframe as well. If you have any Guild equipment \(e.g. loaner laptop\) that hasn’t been returned within 10 days of your last day, we will send you an invoice for the cost of the equipment. See your Enrollment Agreement for more information._

### **Money Stuff**

If you leave the Program after the cancellation period your ISAs will be adjusted based on your last day of program attendance. If you are leaving as a result of a [Phase Boundary Interview](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#pbi),  we will consider your last day of program attendance to be the Friday of the week you attempt your last Coding Challenge/Interview, and will calculate an adjusted Pay It Forward ISA based on this day. Your adjusted Living Fund ISA will reflect the actual amount of stipend you've received so far. You'll receive confirmation of these adjusted ISAs in a separate email from VEMO, and will be able to see this reflected in your VEMO account as well. 

**Your final stipend disbursement will be the last one received on or before your final day as an active Learner. Whether the disbursement aligns with your final day in the program depends upon your disbursement schedule.**

Once you leave the program VEMO is your point of contact for questions about your ISAs.

* VEMO's customer service number is **813-724-3411.**

* Their hours of operation are **8am - 8pm EST Monday-Friday**.

* You can chat with them online at [http://vemo.com/](http://vemo.com/)\(where you access your account\) or you can email them at [answers@vemo.com](mailto:answers@vemo.com).

* You can also text them at the same customer service number listed above.

### Ongoing Guild Membership

When you leave the Learners Guild Program after the cancellation period your relationship to the community transitions from that of [Learner](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#learner) to [Alum](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#alum). One of the key features of our learning community is our commitment to paying it forward by giving back as much as we can. As an Alum, you’re in a unique position to support new Learners not only through the payment of your ISAs, which enables us to continue funding learners, but also by sharing your growing knowledge, skills and network with Learners.

See the Guild Membership section for more information on how we define Guild Membership and the benefits available to all Guild Members \(Learners and Alums\).

### Access to Guild Curriculum and Resources

As an Alum you are welcome to feel free to stay engaged with our curriculum. You may continue your access to modules and projects through our curriculum app \(https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/\). You will need to purchase your own account for modules or projects requiring Treehouse.

You are welcome to come visit if you choose, for example to meet your friends for lunch; however we cannot make the space available to you for co-working or hosting events after hours. We may also host certain “Member co-working hours” - you’ll be notified if and when we implement this feature.

### Changes to Membership Benefits 

As an Alum:

* You will no longer have access to Guild-provided accounts for external sites like Treehouse and FrontEnd Masters. We need to reserve these licenses for currently active learners.

* You will no longer have access to channels of the main Learners Guild Slack instance.

* You will no longer have direct access to Coaches and SEPs. This doesn’t mean you can’t ask questions in the Learners Guild Slack Community, but during Guild hours SEPs and Coaches will be focused on current and active Learners. 

### **Staying in Touch with the Community**

We want you to keep in touch with the community you’ve developed here. You’ll be added to our Guild Alum Slack instance, where you’ll be able to stay in touch with other Guild Members \(Learners and Alums\) and Guild Staff through selected channels. You’ll receive an email invitation to this Slack instance soon after your last day as a Learner.

### Steps for Leaving the Guild

##### Getting Started:

1. Contact your Learning Facilitator via Slack direct message or email to inform them in writing of your intention to either cancel your membership or withdraw from the program. **You must submit your request to leave the program in writing.**
2. Your Learning Facilitator will follow up to collect the following details: 
   * Your reason for leaving Learners Guild.
   * The date of your anticipated last day of attendance.
   * Whether you have in your possession any Learners Guild property requiring return prior to your departure.

##### Preparing to Leave:

1. Return all Guild property to the Office Manager **no later than your second to last day at the Guild**. If the Office Manager is not onsite for any reason, you may return Guild property to your Learning Facilitator.
   1. If you are in possession of a Learners Guild Loaner Laptop, you must return it to Guild Staff in accordance with the Learners Guild Laptop Lending Agreement.
2. Determine how you'd like to inform the Guild Community of your plans to leave. This looks different for different people. Some Learners may choose to send a Slack message, others may choose to share in their House Meeting first, and then share with the rest of the Guild. There's no right or wrong way to say goodbye, we just encourage you to let people know you're leaving. We're sure you'll be missed. 
3. Collect all of your personal belongings from the space - including food items in the refrigerator and cubbies, travel mugs, water bottles, Darth Vader figurines, games, juggling balls, and anything else you may have brought to make the Guild feel like home. 

##### Your Last Day at the Guild:

1. Connect with your Learning Facilitator one last time and make sure you understand the resources available to you after leaving the Guild. You can also consult the [**Resources for Guild Alumni and Community Members**](/General/Membership/resources-for-guild-alumni-and-community-members.md) section of this guide for more information.
2. Get hugs \(if you're into that sort of thing\) and contact information from your friends to stay in touch.
