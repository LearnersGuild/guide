# How to Leave the Program

### Program Participation & Membership Cancellation Period

During your first 5 weeks we expect and encourage you to intentionally explore whether the Guild is the right fit for you.** If during your first 5 weeks you decide you want to leave the Guild for any reason you may elect to cancel your Membership and end your program participation without any financial obligation to the Guild.** **If you stay beyond the 5 week cancellation period you will have a financial obligation under the terms of your Enrollment Agreement and ISA Agreement.** Consult your Enrollment Agreement to understand the full scope of the Cancellation and Refund process, then follow the steps outlined below to get the ball rolling.

### Post-Cancellation Period Withdrawal

If you'd like to withdraw from the program for whatever reason after week 5, you may initiate the withdrawal process by following the steps below. Unlike Program Participation and Membership Cancellation, Withdrawing from the program _after_ the 5 week cancellation period obligates you to payment as specified in your Enrollment Agreement and ISA agreement, if applicable. Again, consult your Enrollment Agreement to understand the full financial implications of leaving the program after the cancellation period.

Please note that you will be invoiced for any Learners Guild property in your possession that is not returned to the Guild prior to your last day of attendance. See your Enrollment Agreement for more information.

### Ongoing Guild Membership

When you leave the Learners Guild Program, your relationship to the community transitions from that of [Learner](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#learner) to [Alum](https://guide.learnersguild.org/GLOSSARY.html#alum). One of the key features of our learning community is our commitment to paying it forward by giving back as much as we can. As an Alum, you’re in a unique position to support new Learners not only through the payment of your ISAs, which enables us to continue funding learners, but also by sharing your growing knowledge, skills and network with Learners.

See the Guild Membership section for more information on how we define Guild Membership and the benefits available to all Guild Members \(Learners and Alums\).

### **Money Stuff**

If you leave the Program after the cancellation period, Your ISAs will be adjusted based on your last day of program attendance. If you are leaving as a result of a Phase Boundary Interview,  we’ll consider your last day of program attendance to be the Friday of the week you attempt your last Coding Challenge/Interview, and will calculate an adjusted Pay It Forward ISA based on this day. Yyour adjusted Living Fund ISA will reflect the actual amount of stipend you've received so far. You'll receive confirmation of these adjusted ISAs in a separate email from VEMO, and will be able to see this reflected in your VEMO account as well. You'll receive confirmation of your final ISAs in a separate email from VEMO, and will be able to see this reflected in your VEMO account as well.

### Steps for Leaving the Guild

##### Getting Started:

1. Contact your Learning Facilitator via Slack direct message or email to inform them in writing of your intention to either cancel your membership or withdraw from the program. **You must submit your request to leave the program in writing.**
2. Your Learning Facilitator will follow up to collect the following details: 
   * Your reason for leaving Learners Guild.
   * The date of your anticipated last day of attendance.
   * Whether you have in your possession any Learners Guild property requiring return prior to your departure.

##### Preparing to Leave:

1. Return all Guild property to the Office Manager **no later than your second to last day at the Guild**.
   1. If you are in possession of a Learners Guild Loaner Laptop, you must return it to Guild Staff in accordance with the Learners Guild Laptop Lending Agreement.
2. Determine how you'd like to inform the Guild Community of your plans to leave. This looks different for different people. Some Learners may choose to send a Slack message, others may choose to share in their House Meeting first, and then share with the rest of the Guild. There's no right or wrong way to say goodbye, we just encourage you to let people know you're leaving. We're sure you'll be missed. 
3. Collect all of your personal belongings from the space - including food items in the refrigerator and cubbies, travel mugs, water bottles, Darth Vader figurines, games, juggling balls, and anything else you may have brought to make the Guild feel like home. 

##### Your Last Day at the Guild:

1. Connect with your Learning Facilitator one last time and make sure you understand the resources available to you after leaving the Guild. You can also consult the [**Resources for Guild Alumni and Community Members**](/General/Membership/resources-for-guild-alumni-and-community-members.md) section of this guide for more information.
2. Get hugs \(if you're into that sort of thing\) and contact information from your friends to stay in touch.
