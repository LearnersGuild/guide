We a handful of policies and they're applicable chapter-wide. Our policies are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. Guild members must abide by all of the policies in the Guide as a condition for continued membership. You can read all Guild policies below in the [Guild Policies Section](/Policies/README.md).
