# Guild Initiated Membership Termination

The terms of your membership in the Guild are governed by your Enrollment Agreement, which incorporates this guide. The terms of your financial agreement with the Guild are specified in the Enrollment Agreement and Income Share Agreement \(ISA\), if applicable. If you decide to withdraw from the program after the stated cancellation period, you may begin that process by contacting your Learning Facilitator. See the **How to Leave the Guild** section for more information on post-cancellation period withdrawals. All financial obligations as specified in the ISA will apply.

**Learners Guild reserves the right to terminate your membership in the Guild as set forth in your Enrollment Agreement, and including under the following cimcumstances:**

* Failure to meet the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md)** **outlined above can result in the termination of our investment and cancellation of your membership.

  * _**In particular, failure to be accepted into phases 2, 3 or 4 by week \(8\) eight of the current phase may immediately result in membership termination.**_

* 5 consecutive days of non-participation in the program without communicating with the staff. See the **No call, No Show **section of the [**Time Commitment**](//Policies/Time_Commitment.md) policy in the Guide.

* Failure to uphold Learners Guild's culture. In particular,

  * Being out of integrity with the non-technical membership expectations \(Attendance and Community Expectations\) as set forth in the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section of this Guide.

For purposes of clarity, termination of your membership in the Guild as referenced in this Guide is the same as the termination of your participation in the Program, as referenced in your Enrollment Agreement.

### **Guild Policies Overview**

We have a handful of policies and they're applicable chapter-wide. Our policies are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. Guild members must abide by all of the policies in the Guide as a condition for continued membership. You can read all Guild policies below in the [Guild Policies Section](/Policies/README.md).

## New Learner Progress Check

Joining the Guild is a two-way street. You're making a commitment to a 10 month program and to working for at least 3 years in the tech industry. We are making a commitment to invest in you - to invest technical and non-technical training, to welcome you into a vibrant community and to offer finanical support so you can land your first developer job. It's a big commitment for both of us. As such, itâ€™s important that we both get a sense of whether or not this is the right learning enviroment for you.

**During your fourth week at the Guild you'll be required to complete a coding challenge assessing how well you're progressing in our learning model and acclimating to our culture.**

The technical evaluation will cover modules you've completed during your first 3 weeks in Phase 1. We'll also explore how you're faring in the Guild's culture - are you maintaining Guild community agreements? Keeping up with your accountabilities? Using the interpersonal tools we've shared to maintain good relationships in the community, etc?

We base our decision to continue investing in you on the data collected via the week four New Learner Progress Check. At this time, Learners Guild may assess that we cannot continue investing in you and you may be asked to leave the guild. Conversely, you may decide that the Guild isn't the best place for you to pursue your career as a web developer and you can voluntarily terminate your membership without any finanical obligation to the Guild. See How to Leave the Guild for more information.
