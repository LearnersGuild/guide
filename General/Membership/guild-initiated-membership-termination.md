# Guild Initiated Membership Termination

The terms of your membership in the Guild are governed by your Enrollment Agreement, which incorporates this guide. The terms of your financial agreement with the Guild are specified in the Enrollment Agreement and Income Share Agreement \(ISA\), if applicable. If you decide to withdraw from the program after the stated cancellation period, you may begin that process by contacting your Learning Facilitator. See the [**How to Leave the Guild**](/General/Membership/learner-initiated-membership-cancelation-period.md) section for more information on post-cancellation period withdrawals. All financial obligations as specified in the Enrollment Agreement and ISA, if applicable, will apply.

#### Learners Guild reserves the right to terminate your membership in the Guild as set forth in your Enrollment Agreement, including under the following cimcumstances:

* Failure to meet the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md)** **previously** **outlined can result in the withdrawal of our investment and termination of your membership. In particular:

  * Failure to be accepted into phases 2, 3 or 4 by week \(8\) eight of the current phase may immediately result in membership termination.

  * Failure to uphold Learners Guild's culture by being out of integrity with the non-technical membership expectations around Attendance and Community Expectations as set forth in the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section of this Guide may immediately result in membership termination. Membership termination under these particular circumstances may be initiated by Learning Facilitators.

For purposes of clarity, termination of your membership in the Guild as referenced in this Guide is the same as the termination of your participation in the Program, as referenced in your Enrollment Agreement.

#### **Guild Policies Overview**

We have a handful of policies and they're applicable chapter-wide. Our policies are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. Guild members must abide by all of the policies in the Guide as a condition for continued membership. You can read all Guild policies below in the [**Guild Policies Section**](/Policies/README.md)**.**
