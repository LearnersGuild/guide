# Learning at the Guild: Phases \| Supports \| Strategies

Learning at the Guild happens in a range of contexts and formats. The three learning sections of the Guide are meant to orient you to the Guild's learning model and to give you the resources and tools you need to make the most out of your time and effort.

Our web development program is organized into five distinct learning phases, with the learning focus shifting slightly as you progress from one phase to another.
