# Learner Onboarding

Prep work completed? Check.

Start day coming up? Check.

Curious about what your first week at the Guild will be like? Great!

This section of the Guide is designed to help you get settled and up to speed on our shared systems and space protocols. You will be assigned an Onboarding Mentor a week or two before your start date. They are available via email and Slack to answer your questions and help you navigate the Guild once you arrive.

### GENERAL INFORMATION

### Read the Guides

The Learner Guide \(referred to as The Guide\) and the Cultural Operating System \(COS\) Guide contain just about everything you need to know about how things work at the Guild. We regularly update the Guides to reflect the latest information about our Learning Operating System \(LOS\) and Cultural Operating System \(COS\). Periodically you may catch one of the Guides in "mid-edit" and some information may be outdated. Feel free to [submit an issue to this repo](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/guide/issues), or to hang tight until the final edits are updated.

1. Learning Operating System (LOS):

2. Cultural Operating System (COS):

### Setup Direct Deposit for your Stipend

If you are receiving a stipend through the **Learner Living Fund**, your first disbursement will arrive at the end of the second week of the program.

1. Set up direct deposit for your stipend disbursements by calling \(813\) 724-3411 x102. Setting up direct deposit during your first week ensures that you’ll receive your first stipend disbursement electronically rather than a paper check. You’ll need the following information:

   1. Bank Name

   2. Bank Account Number

   3. Bank Account Type \(checking or savings\)

   4. ABA Routing Number

### Join and start using Slack

We use Slack as our primary communication tool. Your LOS credentials will also give you access to our Slack teams. Visit the [Slack and Echo](/General/Slack_and_Echo.md) section for an overview of our use of the platform. **And remember, please be judicious with your use of @channel or @here notifications during work hours - unless a message requires everyone’s immediate attention, limit @channel mentions to the hours before 9:00am and after 5:30pm. **

### Join these Trello Boards

We use these Trello boards to centralize important guild-wide information. Join by clicking on the links below:

1. **Space Roles**: a place where we capture and fill roles needed to keep our space clean and running smoothly. Every month a different house is responsible for taking care of the "core space roles." That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pitch in to keep our shared space clean though - keeping the Guild clean is a shared responsibility: [https://trello.com/invite/b/P6NuDGZH/f8dd29da8c1632d53ce4cdd5fcdb1ad8/lg-space-roles](https://trello.com/invite/b/P6NuDGZH/f8dd29da8c1632d53ce4cdd5fcdb1ad8/lg-space-roles)

2. **Space Agreements**: read more about these in the pinned post in the \#space channel: [https://trello.com/invite/b/KlCe030a/e568feb3c017b11ba8cfa08c471e12b2/lg-spaceagreements](https://trello.com/invite/b/KlCe030a/e568feb3c017b11ba8cfa08c471e12b2/lg-spaceagreements)

### Join the Oakland Events Calendar

We use the Oakland Guild Events calendar to schedule guild-related events that we should all be aware of. Reach out to fellow learner, ZeZe \(@zezecodez on Slack\), to be added to the calendar.

### Door Code & Guild Hours

1. Ask your Onboarding Mentor for the door code - please keep this code confidential and do not share with anyone outside of Learners Guild.

2. The space is open from 7:00am to 10:00pm, Monday through Friday, and 10:00am - 10:00pm on Saturday and Sunday - you may only be in the space between these hours.

3. The doors are "unfrozen" between 8:30am and 6:00pm - this means your code will **not** work outside these hours. If you arrive before 8:30am, enter through the main building using the elevator and rear doors. If you stay past 6:00pm, you must ring the doorbell to be let back into the building. **Never prop front or rear doors open.**

### Help keep the Guild clean

As a shared working space, it's important that the Guild is comfortable and operational. We all work together to make this possible by taking responsibility for ourselves and our space. Here are a couple tips that will help you ease into the Guild's space culture.

1. **End of day mini-reset:** Do a basic workstation clean up at the end of your day: Push in your chair; put mugs or cups in the dishwasher, put trash in the garbage or recycling.

2. **Leave it better than you found it: **tread lightly on our space so everyone can enjoy it and always clean up after yourself. If you eat lunch on the front couch, make sure your coffee mugs, soda cans and food plates are cleaned up so the next person can use the space without having to clean up after you.

   1. Wash all dishes as soon as you use them - loading them into the dishwasher is fine, do not leave them in the sink. If you see a stray dish, go ahead and take care of it - let’s help each other keep our shared spaces clean.

   2. Fridges are cleaned out of unmarked food on Wednesday and Friday. Mark your food, only eat what’s yours, and clear it out frequently.

   3. Use a bin or cubby to keep dry goods at the Guild during the week - because of limited fridge space, we ask that you only bring and refrigerate food that you are planning to eat that day - please do not plan to store food in the refrigerators for the entire week \(or longer\).

   Visit the [Oakland Building](/Policies/Oakland_Building.md) section to read additional information about the space and other building policies.
