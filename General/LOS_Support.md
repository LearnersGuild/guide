# ECHO & Curriculum Support

You may periodically run into a bug in Echo, our learning platform, or need support navigating with some aspect Echo or the Curriculum site, rather than your specific learning challenge. In such a case, you can reach out to the LOS team via Slack and Github. Before reaching out, make sure to identify the kind of support you need:

## Non-urgent Support

* If you need non-urgent support please [create a GitHub issue on the LOS repo](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/los/issues/new). For example: if you can't upload an avatar to your Slack profile you'd submit an issue to the LOS repo. We count anything as 'non-urgent' if it's not blocking your learning progress for the day. 

## Urgent Support

* If you need urgent support please ask for it in the [Echo-support Slack channel](https://learnersguild.slack.com/messages/C4X8T7UBT/). For example: if your Echo profile lists the wrong phase \(you're really in Phase 3, but it says Phase 2\), or if you were assigned to the wrong team. We count anything as 'urgent' that blocks your learning progress for the day.
