## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the time commitment?**

See the [Time Commitment][time-commitment] page

**Do you kick people out? Why? How? Will I know ahead of time?**

Any member of Learners Guild can ask someone else to leave by using our formal [Conflict Resolution Process][cos-conflict-resolution-process]. Usually, this is because they have consistently violated our shared agreements.

**Can I re-join a later if it turns out the timing isn't good for me?**

We make selections carefully and cannot guarantee you a spot at another time. Please make sure that you've considered all scheduling challenges ahead of time so that you can commit to your assigned start date.

If you have to leave, and need to re-join a later time, you can do so as long as the next start date is within 40 weeks of your original start date. If you need to leave for longer, then you will have to quit and re-apply.

You can only change start dates once. After that, you will need to quit and re-apply.

**What if I change my mind after I sign this contract?**

By signing this contract, you're letting us know that you are certain about your commitment to Learners Guild. If you change your mind after signing the contract and choose not to join the program, we cannot offer your spot to another learner for that start date. While we don't ask for a deposit, there will be a $250 cancellation fee if you sign a contract and decide not to join the Guild within 3 weeks of your start date. Please carefully consider your decision, and sign only when you are a joyful and confident "yes". If you need to seek the opinion of a trusted third party, we highly encourage you to do so.

**What's the consequence for leaving the program early?**

During the fourth week of the program, you'll have an opportunity to reflect on your first three weeks at Learners Guild and on the path ahead. If for some reason you've decided that becoming a software engineer is not the path you want to pursue, or that you don't wish to continue pursuing that path with Learners Guild, you'll have an opportunity to leave the program and pay only a $250 cancellation fee. Past that point, you are financially committed and obligated to the full Income Share Agreement with Learners Guild.

**What's required? What's optional? (Projects, Player Support Group, COS Workshops)**

With other learners, you collectively choose the projects you work on - no specific project is required, many things may be offered or suggested by a Practitioner or Learning Facilitator. What is required is that you participate fully in the structure of the program:

- you vote on choosing a goal and join a project to work towards each week
- you dedicate yourself to it for the week
- you complete the weekly retrospective
- you attend daily standups, weekly Player Support Group meetings (and weekly COS Workshops, in your first five weeks)
- you serve as a coach when it's your turn to do so
- you observe and adhere to the policies outlined in the Learner Guide

Similar to the projects you choose to work on, you may choose to revisit COS Workshops that support goals you have for yourself or address feedback you're receiving from peers, practitioners, or facilitators.

**What if I start a project and don't want to keep working on it?**

Talk to your team and see if you can come to a compromise. Ultimately, the choice is yours, but abandoning your team will have consequences for your stats (not to mention your social standing among your peers). The same rules apply as in a workplace: you are responsible for your own productivity, and if you're not happy on a project, you should tell your team and work together to find a way forward.

**Can I choose who I want to work with?**

By joining the Guild, you're making an agreement to collaborate with anyone and everyone else in the Guild on a given project at a given time. Just like in the working world, you don't get to choose the people you're assigned to work on teams and projects with.

**What if I have a conflict with someone that I can't resolve on my own?**

Conflicts happen. It's natural. And in most cases working through conflicts with our teammates only serves to improve our relationships and the working environment. Our intention is to empower you to resolve interpersonal conflicts you may have with others. If the conflict is tenacious, there is a [formal conflict resolution process][cos-conflict-resolution-process] in place (in the COS) to support you in resolving it.


**Do I need my own computer?**

Yes, you need to have a Mac laptop that's less than 3 years old. Everyone at Learners Guild uses a Mac, so it will be easier for you to collaborate with your team if you are all using the same platform.

**I don't have a Mac laptop. What should I do?**

We can provide you a loaner laptop for use during the first four weeks of the program. After that, you will need to have your own. You can opt to receive funds in order to purchase a laptop, as provided in the enrollment agreement.

**Can I use the loaner laptop for personal use? Are there any limits to what I can install on this laptop or what I can use it for?**

Yes, you can use it for personal activities. However, you will need to wipe the hard drive and perform a clean OS install before giving it back to us at the end of the loaner period. It is an expensive piece of machinery, so please take good care of it and leave it in good condition for the next learner who inherits it.

You can install anything on the laptop, so long as it is legal.

**What platforms and operating systems does Learners Guild use?**

Apple computers running the latest Mac OS. If you are used to a Windows or Linux environment, there will be a learning curve, but it is worth it. Being able to use a Mac well is a useful skill in this field.

**Is there a dress code?**

Casual, but professional. As in, we want you to be comfortable and that looks different ways to different people. So feel free to be in the full expression of your personal style, but maybe leave the pj's at home.

**What if I can't get a job?**

Keep learning and studying. We all learn at different paces. As long as your keeping your agreements with the Guild, there is no limit to how long you can stay and keep practicing your craft.

**What if I change my mind and don't want to be a software developer?**

We would be sorry to hear that, but of course it is your choice. You would still be bound to the financial agreement you sign, and access to all of the resources offered to Learners Guild alumnae. If you have doubts about pursuing this career before joining, please let us know ASAP. Our business depends on your commitment to becoming a software developer.

**What if I want to do a startup after?**

Learners Guild's business model depends on our learners "paying forward" their tuition through an Income Sharing Agreement in their first 3 years earning income after graduating the program. If you have plans to start your own company, please elect to pay our program fees upfront.


**What if I'm not making more than $50,000 per year?**

Income sharing only applies if your income is more than $50,000. The $50,000 includes self-employed income that you may be making as a consultant. And, in certain cases, gains from equity that you received as a result of your work for a company. Please see the Income Share Agreement for more details.

**What if I get fired from my first job or decide to quit?**

If you're unemployed, and your income is less than $50,000, the Income Sharing Agreement is paused until you're making at least $50,000.
