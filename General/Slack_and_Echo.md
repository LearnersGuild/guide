# Slack & Echo

Echo is the persona that represents the LOS system. We use [Slack](https://learnersguild.slack.com/) as our primary system for communication at the Guild, and you'll occasionally see messages from [Echo](https://learnersguild.slack.com/messages/@echo/) in slack. You can sign-in to Slack at [https://learnersguild.slack.com](https://learnersguild.slack.com).

Echo and the LOS are under active development. If you encounter a bug or notice something that could be better, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/los/issues/new) for the LOS repo. You can also ask questions and offer feedback using Slack in the #guild-feedback channel. We love to hear feedback and believe that together we can build a more effective system.

### Slack Guidelines

**Slack is our primary communication tool.** Since there are so many of us communicating on the platform, it's important to observe some common guidelines. These guidelines support us in making the most of using Slack while minimizing distractions:

#### Managing **OUTPUT**:

Guidance for managing the volume of posts and notifications we generate:

1. **Be discerning about WHO you tag - almost never use a **`@channel`** notification.** Only use an `@channel` notification if it's imperative that everyone in the channel read the message you have sent - assume they will, and that therefore you are interrupting the attention and focus of every person in that channel. `@channel` is the equivalent of ringing the gong. Would you ring the gong for this message? Differentiate between "I'd like everyone to read this" and "Everyone must read this". Posts in the \#watercooler channel, for example, never warrant an `@channel` notification, as it is an entirely recreational / optional channel.

2. **Be disciplined about WHEN you post.** Do people need to read your message RIGHT NOW? If not, it doesn't warrant a mid-day `@channel` notification. Unless it is urgent or an emergency, do not use an `@channel` notification between the hours of 9:00am and 5:30pm. You can also use the `@here` notification to notify only those folks who are online at any given time.

3. **Be thoughtful about WHERE you post.** Post information only in the most highly relevant places. If it's about the office space, use the \#space channel. If it's only relevant to November folks, use the cohort channel. If it's about a movie outing you want to plan, use the \#watercooler channel. If you find yourself posting something in three different channels, ask someone's opinion about where it belongs and only post it there. The \#significant-updates channel should be reserved for content that everyone in the Guild must be aware of in a timely fashion.

4. **Be sparing about creating new channels:** A new channel should only be created for an entirely new topic that will generate ongoing discussion. The more channel clutter there is, the less likely we are to pay attention.

#### Managing **INPUT**:

Guidance for managing the volume of posts and notifications you are fielding and suggestions for protecting your attention throughout the day:

* **Choose your channels wisely**. Only join channels that you wish to stay up to date with. To ensure smooth Guild-wide communication, all Learners are required to join and monitor the following channels:

| **\#Oakland** | **\#YourHouseChannel** | **\#YourPhaseChannel** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **\#Onboarding** | **\#Guild-Announcements** | **\#Space** |

* **Choose your other channels carefully.** Hide or leave channels you're done with. Keep it clean.

  * For example, after a couple weeks at the Guild you may choose to hide the \#Onboarding channel

* **Make Slack a "pull", not "push" experience**. Decide whether you'd like to turn desktop notifications for Slack off during the day. Schedule set times that you'll catch up on messages - e.g. before standup, over lunch, and right before you leave. Make Slack work for you, don't work for Slack. \(Or actually, _working for Slack_ is a great aspiration. Just make sure their app isn't distracting you during the day.\)

### Special drill down on @channel notifications:

`@channel` notifications are costly for our attention, flow, and productivity. You should almost never use them. Ask yourself:

* "Does everyone really need to know about this?"
  * If the answer is **NO**, then please be strategic about who you tag and/or where you are posting.
  * If the answer is **YES, **but** **it's the middle of the day, ask yourself: "Do they need to know **NOW**? Is it worth breaking their attention? Would I ring the gong to announce it? Is it urgent or an emergency?" If the answer is **YES**, go ahead and post.
  * If the answer is **NO**, wait to post it before 9:00am or after 5:30pm.

#### **Use an @channel notification for these types of messages**:

* \#oakland: `@channel` pools are broken, and being fixed. Ignore them right now, and let's meet at the light side for coach-queue presentation _\(Necessary to coordinate the whole group in real-time, ok to post mid-day\)_
* \#oakland: `@channel` I got a phone call late last night from Tish, head of our Old Oakland security team, who informed me that she found one of the front doors left ajar around 11:30pm. Please be conscious of making sure the doors are fully closed behind you, especially if you are leaving after 6:30pm. _\(Impacts everyone in the Guild, but not urgent - should be posted before 9:00am or after 5:30pm\)_

#### **Do NOT use an @channel notification for these types of messages**:

* \#space: `@channel` if you see a mac charger with a github sticker on it, please let me know. Thanks _\(Not necessary that everyone be notified about the missing charger - those who see the message will keep an eye out\)_
* \#oakland: `@channel` leaving early today. See ya'll tomorrow! _\(Not necessary to let everyone know if you have to take off early\)_
