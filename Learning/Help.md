# Got Help?

Everyone needs a little help sometimes. In addition to SEP support, there are also Pro Coaches available to answer questions and help you get unstuck as you go about your daily work. We recommend reaching out for help in the following order:

* Google it - no really, google it and google it again.
* Request help in the #help channel. SEPs and Pro Coaches assigned to your phase will be pinged, but quite often your peers in the program will also be able to chime in with a helpful response. Make sure to include the actual request for help. For example: `@here: Can someone explain the difference between mocha and chai?`

### Recorded Lectures & Office Hour Talks

You can access recordings of lectures and office hours on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC599lkzf-2haPTzDAMGEgLg).

### How do I get clarity on specs that are unclear?

If you're working on a project and are unclear about expectations, the first thing to do is ask your teammates. If you're not able to sort it out, reach out to a Pro Coach or and SEP.

Once you've found the clarification you need, consider submitting a pull request for an improvement to the project's documentation.
