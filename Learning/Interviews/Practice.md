# Practice Phase Interview

In the Practice phase interview, you will be expected to demonstrate your ability to write JavaScript programs for the Node.js platform and for the browser, to create simple HTTP applications, to write HTML & CSS to give structure and style to a web page, and use SQL to persist and retrieve data from a relational database.

You will _not_ be expected to demonstrate an ability to build full-stack web apps from the ground up. You will be asked to complete the implementation of features for front-end and/or back-end environments but will not need to know how to integrate every component in a full-stack app.

### Skills Evaluated

- HTML & CSS (Beginner)

- Programming (Beginner)

- HTTP (Beginner)

- JavaScript (Beginner)

- Node.js (Beginner)

- Express (Beginner)

- SQL (Beginner)

Some examples of specific things you _might_ be required to do as part of the interview coding challenge (this is **not** an exhaustive list):

- Create static HTML & CSS pages from mockups and wireframes

- Manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript and common libraries like jQuery

- Build a web server with Node.js and Express

- Implement RESTful routing in a web app for CRUD behavior

- Apply asynchronous programming patterns in JavaScript (example: callback functions and/or promises)

- Throw custom errors from JavaScript

- Use SQL to create database schemas

- Use SQL to query joined tables

- Use SQL to persist data

- Make queries to a database from within a Node.js program

#### Secondary Skills

The following skills are _important_ but will not be _explicitly_ a part of the coding challenge. You will need some fluency in them in order to complete the challenge.

- Meta Learning (Beginner)

  - example: use Google to search for help

- Code Editor (Beginner)

  - example: use Atom or Sublime to edit and save code

- UNIX Shell / Terminal (Beginner)

  - example: start and stop processes

- Debugging (Beginner)

  - example: use Chrome developer tools inspect the DOM
