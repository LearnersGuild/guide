# Preparing for the Phase Interview

#### Live Coding Challenge

For the coding challenge, an interviewer will meet with you in a 1:1 setting. The interview might take place in person or remotely using collaboration tools (e.g. Zoom video and a collaborative code editor). Your interviewer must observe you solving the challenge in real-time.

During the interview, you will be allowed to use the internet to search for reference material. You'll also be allowed to ask the interviewer clarifying questions. Your interviewr might ask you questions about your process to help you get unstuck if they deem it helpful, but they cannot otherwise assist you in solving the challenge.

#### Phase Interview Topics

To learn what each phase interview covers and how to prepare, see the phase-specific interview pages:

* [Practice](/Learning/Interviews/Practice.md)

* [Area 45](/Learning/Interviews/Area_45.md)

#### Interview Results

THe outcome of your interview will be based on only one thing: your having demonstrated an ability to complete enough of the coding challenge specs within the allotted time (1 hour). A completion score of 80% or greater will result in a Pass outcome, and you'll be invited to begin the next phase. A completion score of less than 80% will result in a No Pass outcome. In this case, you'll be provided with detailed feedback about your performance and will be expected to continue focused study/practice before reattempting the interview (following a specified waiting period).

### Interview Prep Tips

Make sure to read the overview for your specific interview when preparing. We also recommend that you take following steps to lessen the effects of test anxiety.

* Before the coding challenge:

  * Study the relevant skills and take notes for yourself.

  * Complete the practice version of the challenge. Time yourself and possibly find a buddy or coach to sit and observe you while you perform the self-assessment. If you find that you've run out of time and still have lots of specs unfinished, it should serve as a signal that you don't yet understand the concepts and tools well enough to make the most of your time in the next phase. Use this feedback to focus your study & practice on the areas you struggled with before trying the self-assessment again (and eventually, the real interview challenge).

  * When practicing (and really, when writing any code at all), consider the following:

    * What is the purpose of this function|statement|expression?

    * How does data flow through the application? Where/how is it stored during the application's lifecycle?

    * What are the inputs and outputs?

    * How is undesirable behavior handled (e.g. invalid input)?

    * How will the computer evaluate this code?

    * How are the project files organized? What does each file do?

  * Get plenty of sleep. Exercise. Eat well. Take care of yourself. :-\)

* During the coding challenge...

  * Make sure to read the instructions very closely.

  * **Don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions!** There are no tricks/gotchas in the coding challenges; if a requirement isn't completely clear, your interviewer should clarify it.

  * You can still pass the interview if you don't complete every spec. Do as much as you can, and prioritize completing the parts you do understand over struggling through things you don't know very well. Feel free to jump around and save the hardest parts for last.
