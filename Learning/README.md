# Learning Supports

The Guild is a resource rich environment, offering a mix of various phase specific learning supports including [SEP](//GLOSSARY.md) lectures, live code reviews, and cognitive apprenticeship sessions.

As Learners move from one phase to another, different supports are needed. Early on in the program, Learners benefit from a sequenced curriculum with intentional scaffolding and guided support. As Learners move through the program their work begins to simulate real-life web development teams with the benefit of a senior engineer's guidance.

Each phase has an assigned [SEP](//GLOSSARY.md) serving as the technical “point person” for the duration of a learner’s time in the phase. The earlier phases also have assigned pro-coaches.

## Phase Specific Supports

**Check the Phase Calendar for your phase for lecture and office hour times.**
