# Phases

There are 3 sequential learning phases in our web development program. A phase is a roughy 12-week period of time during which Learners learn a new a set of skills and put those skills into practice in preparation for employment as a web developer. To begin work in any phase after the Foundations phase, Learners must successfully complete a phase interview which consists mainly of a 1-hour live coding challenge. See more details in the [Interviews](./Interviews) section.

### Program Design

The arc of our 40-week program follows your growth as a web developer. The early stages offer more structure and a narrower focus than the later stages. The idea is that when we’re learning something new, we need more help with figuring out what we don't know but need to as well as how to learn it. As we become more competent, we’re increasingly prepared to work on more complex problems _and_ to direct our own paths. The structure and content of the sequential phases are meant to help facilitate your transition from novice web developer to a more experienced apprentice.

In Foundations, you'll work through highly structured weekly modules. You'll spend the first couple of days in the week in focused study, followed by a couple of days of small project work. At the end of each day you'll reflect on your progress that day, and at the end of the week you'll demo your working application.

In the Practice Phase, you'll be introduced to some collaborative software development tools and techniques. And be expected to apply the foundational skills you acquired in Foundations to building full-stack apps each week in teams of 2 or 3. Many of these projects will be in the form of a "snapshot goal" where you're provided with an existing codebase and expected to complete the implementation of one or more are of the application. Some other projects will require creating a repo from the ground up. At the end of the week you'll reflect on your work and demo the functionality you implemented.

When you reach Area 45, you have the freedom to largely self-direct your own work (provided that work is still primarily some form of web application development). You'll be **_required_** to create a weekly work plan and to review it with an SEP during your weekly check-ins. This is the point at which you should -- if you haven't already -- begin to hone in on the specific kinds of tools, products and companies you're interested in. SEPs will help you develop an individualized growth plan. You can define & design your own projects, or you'll have the opportunity to jump onto an existing development team for a live system, such as the Guild's Learning Operating System. Making a meaningful contribution to open source software is also an acceptable use of the time. Finally, you'll also have acces various job search and interview prep resources.
