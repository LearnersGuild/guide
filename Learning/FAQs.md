# Learning Model FAQs

#### How long should it take a learner to complete a phase?

Learners should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising their learning. As a rule of thumb, learner should not spend more than 12 weeks in a single phase and are expected to make a attempt to progress to the next phase within the first 10 weeks. We strongly recommend requesting a Phase Interview as soon as you feel adequately prepared in order to maximize the amount of time available in Area 45 for more a personalized growth plan.

#### How do I know which phase I’m in?

Upon enrollment, all learners begin in the Foundations Phase. Learners then interview into each of the following phases through a technical interview process. You can see your phase placement in the curriculum app.

#### Is someone responsible for ‘running’ each phase?

One or more Leads are assigned to each phase. Some phases also have dedicated Pro Coaches.

#### Can learners return to a previous phase after they’ve moved on?

No. If a learner successfully interviews into the next phase, they cannot return to a previous phase.

#### If I interview out of my phase in fewer than 12 weeks, will I be able to still remain in the program for the full term?

Yes. If you move through the phases at a rate faster than 12 weeks/phase, you'll be able to "bank" the leftover time in Area 45. For example: if your program term is 40 weeks and you interview into both the Practice Phase and Area 45 in 10 weeks each, you'll have up to 20 weeks to spend in Area 45.

#### What counts as a successful Phase Interview?

Learners who complete 80% or more of the the requirements for a phase interview challenge will be accepted into the phase for which they’re interviewing.

#### How many times can a learner take a Phase Interview?

As many times as you need to, subject to a 2 week waiting period between attempts.

#### How do learners access the curriculum for each phase?

Visit the curriculum repo: [https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum. ).

#### How do I get help?

You can request help in Slack in the \#help channel.

# Membership, Program Participation & Financial FAQs

#### How is Guild Membership determined?

When you are accepted to Learners Guild, you join our ever-growing community of Members \(Learners and Alums\). If you stay in the program past your 5th week, your Guild Membership stays with you for as long as our doors are open. Our intent is to foster a professional community that starts when you join the Guild, but that reaches far beyond your time as a Learner.

**There are two exceptions:** the first is if you decide to leave or are asked to leave by your 5th week. In this case, you Guild Membership and financial obligation to the Guild is terminated. See the [**New Learner Progress Check**](///General/Membership/new-learner-progress-check.md) section for more information.

The second is if you are in serious violation of any of the Guild Policies, in which case the Guild reserves the right to revoke your Membership. See the [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md) section for more information.

See the [**Guild Membership** ](//General/Membership.md)and [**Membership Termination **](/General/Membership/membership-termination.md)sections for more information.

#### **How is Program Participation determined?**

A learner maintains membership in the Guild by staying in compliance with the stated [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) and [**Guild Policies**](//Policies/README.md)**. **Failure to comply with membership expectations and policies can result in potential [**program**](/General/Membership/guild-initiated-membership-termination.md) and/or [**membership**](/General/Membership/membership-termination.md) termination.

#### Is there a cancellation period?

Yes. Your first few weeks are a bit of a test drive - for you and for us. We want to ensure you will thrive in the Guild's learning environment so during your first 5 weeks we invite you to work hard, test the model, and assess whether or not the Guild is a good fit for you. You have up to week 5 to cancel your membership without financial obligations if you conclude the Guild is not the right learning environment for you. During week 4 all new Learners are required to take the New Learner Progress Check - it's our way of determining how well you're learning in our model and whether or not we will continue to invest in you. **Ongoing program participation and membership is dependent upon a successful Progress Check. See the **[**New Learner Progress Check**](/General/Membership/new-learner-progress-check.md)** section for  more information. **

#### **Can I leave and join a later cohort if the timing isn't good for me?**

We make selections carefully and cannot guarantee you a spot at another time. If you withdraw from the program you must reapply to be considered for an upcoming cohort.

#### What if I realize the Guild isn't right for me after the cancellation period is over?

You can withdraw from the program at anytime after the cancellation period has passed. The only difference is that you will be financially obligated under the terms of your Enrollment Agreement and ISA, if applicable. See the [**How to Leave the Program**](/General/Membership/learner-initiated-membership-cancelation-period.md) section for more information.

#### What happens to my ISAs if my program participation is terminated or if I choose to leave the program?

If your program participation is terminated before your anticipated graduation date, you are responsible for the financial obligations under your ISA\(s\) based on the duration of your program participation and amount of living stipend, if any, that has been disbursed to you. See your ISA contracts and Enrollment Agreement for more details.

#### What if I realize I don't want to be a web developer?

We would be sorry to hear that, but of course it is your choice. If you realize the Learners Guild Program is not for you, you are still obligated to the payment terms indicated in your ISA agreement\(s\). Our ability to operate and invest in future learners is dependent upon you paying back on your ISA regardless of if you decide to be a web developer or not. We have limited slots to invest in Learners so if you are not sure you want to take on this commitment you should get clear before joining the program.

#### What's required? What's optional?

Please see the [**Membership Expectations**](/General/Membership/membership-expectations.md) section to read all non-negotiable requirements for Learners. **But, the short of the long is you are required to participate fully in the structure of the program by:**

* Diligently work on the modules and projects for your phase.

* Dedicating yourself to your work and your team \(if you have one\).

* Attending daily standups, lectures, House Meetings, and COS Workshops, and communicating clearly ahead of time to the relevant people if you will miss a scheduled meeting or required gathering.

* Observing and adhering to [Guild Policies](//Policies/README.md).

You may choose to revisit COS Workshops that support goals you have for yourself or address feedback you're receiving from peers, SEPs, or facilitators.

#### What is the time commitment?

See the [Time Commitment](../Policies/Time_Commitment.md) page.

#### Do we get time off?

Yes, we observe all national holidays. Check the [Holiday List](//General/Holiday_List.md) for Guild closure dates. We also take one week off for the winter holiday season/new year's, and another week off during the summer. Depending on when you're at the Guild, you may have one, or both of those weeks off. Every Learner also has ten \(10\) personal days and three \(3\) professional development days to use over the course of their 40 weeks. See the [Time Commitment ](//Policies/Time_Commitment.md)section for more details.

#### What if I can't get hired after the Guild?

Keep learning, studying, building software and applying for jobs. All Guild Alums have access to online curriculum resources and may take advantage of Area 45 Career Prep resources for 36 months following graduation. See the [**Guild Membership**](//General/Membership.md) section for more information on Member Benefits for Learners and Alums.

#### What if I want to found a startup after I finish at the Guild?

Our business model depends on our members "paying it forward" - in other words, it depends on our members paying the Guild through their Income Sharing Agreement during their first three \(3\) years of employment. Startup life can be unpredictable, so in order for us to continue offering the program with no upfront costs, it's imperative that graduated learners are in a position to repay their ISA. If you plan to start your own company, please elect to pay our program fees upfront.

#### What if I'm not making more than $50,000 per year?

Income sharing only applies if your income is more than $50,000 annually, including income from self-employment or consulting work. In certain cases, gains from equity that you received as a result of your work for a company also counts as 'income'. Please see the Income Share Agreement for more details.

#### What if I get fired from my first job or decide to quit?

If you're unemployed, and your income is less than $50,000, the Income Sharing Agreement is paused until you're making at least $50,000.

#### When do I have to start paying my ISA?

Members are afforded a three-month grace period after they complete or withdraw from the Guild before payments are required.

#### Do I need my own computer?

Yes, you need to have a Mac laptop that's less than 3 years old. Everyone at Learners Guild uses a Mac, so it will be easier for you to collaborate with others and get troubleshooting support from our staff. Visit the [**Qualified Laptop**](/Runway/qualified-laptop.md)** **page for more information.

#### What if I can't get a new Mac laptop by my start date? What should I do?

You can elect to borrow a laptop from the Guild for use through the Foundations Phase. Make sure to select this option on your Enrollment Agreement. It will require a separate Loaner Agreement.

#### What platforms and operating systems does Learners Guild use?

Apple computers running the latest Mac OS. If you are used to a Windows or Linux environment, there will be a learning curve, but it is worth it. Being able to use a Mac well is a useful skill in this field.

#### What if I have a conflict with someone that I can't resolve on my own?

Conflicts happen. It's natural. And in most cases working through conflicts with our colleagues only serves to improve our relationships and the working environment. Our intention is to empower you to resolve interpersonal conflicts you may have with others by using the interpersonal tools we share in the [**COS**](https://cos.learnersguild.org/Practice_Tending_Relationship/Requests.html). If the conflict is tenacious, there is a [**Formal Request**](https://cos.learnersguild.org/Practice_Tending_Relationship/Conflict.html) process in place to support you in resolving it.

#### Is there a dress code?

Casual, but professional. As in, we want you to be comfortable and that looks different ways to different people. So feel free to be in the full expression of your personal style, but consider leaving the pj's at home.
