# Learning Model FAQs

#### How long should it take a learner to complete a phase?

Learners should aim to move through the beginning of the program as quickly as possible without compromising their learning. As a rule of thumb, learner should not spend more than 12 weeks in a single phase and are expected to make a attempt to progress to the next phase within the first 10 weeks. We strongly recommend requesting a Phase Interview as soon as you feel adequately prepared in order to maximize the amount of time available in Area 45 for more a personalized growth plan.

#### How do I know which phase I’m in?

Upon enrollment, all learners begin in the Foundations Phase. Learners then interview into each of the following phases through a technical interview process. You can see your phase placement in the curriculum app.

#### Is someone responsible for ‘running’ each phase?

One or more Leads are assigned to each phase. Some phases also have dedicated Pro Coaches.

#### Can learners return to a previous phase after they’ve moved on?

No. If a learner successfully interviews into the next phase, they cannot return to a previous phase.

#### If I interview out of my phase in fewer than 12 weeks, will I be able to still remain in the program for the full term?

Yes. If you move through the phases at a rate faster than 12 weeks/phase, you'll be able to "bank" the leftover time in Area 45. For example: if your program term is 40 weeks and you interview into both the Practice Phase and Area 45 in 10 weeks each, you'll have up to 20 weeks to spend in Area 45.

#### What counts as a successful Phase Interview?

Learners who complete 80% or more of the the requirements for a phase interview challenge will be accepted into the phase for which they’re interviewing.

#### How many times can a learner take a Phase Interview?

As many times as you need to, subject to a 2 week waiting period between attempts.

#### How do learners access the curriculum for each phase?

Visit the curriculum repo: [https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/curriculum. ).

#### How do I get help?

You can request help in Slack in the #help channel.
