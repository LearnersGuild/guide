# Pacing Guidelines

Learners are generally expected to spend no more than 12 weeks in any single phase. You should aim to move through the first two phases of the program in particular as quickly as possible without compromising your learning. We encourage you to interview for the next phase as soon as you feel prepared. Keep in mind that the longer you spend in the earlier phases, the less time you'll have available to work in Area 45. To advance from one phase to another, you must schedule and pass a Phase Interview.

You may choose to attempt an interview at any point during your time in a phase with one exception: **in the event of an attempt that results in a No Pass outcome, you will be required to wait two weeks before making another interview attempt**. For example, if you attempt an interview in your 8th week in a phase, the soonest date you can attempt the interview again will be in your 10th week.

See the [**Phase Interview**](//Learning/Interviews/README.md) section for more details.
