# Phase Curriculum

To access the curriculum for each phase visit and bookmark [**https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/**](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/).

As mentioned on in the [Phases](//Learning/Phases.md) overview, the early stages of the program contain structured learning content covering a specific set of content learners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of. Let's say you've developed an understanding of some of the content covered in the Foundations phase prior to joining the Guild; you may not need to spend much time (if any) with the related modules in that phase and could attempt to progress to the next phase sooner. Or, you may choose to try the practice interview challenge to get a sense for how much you know, then work backwards to fill in your gaps.

In the Practice phase, you'll work through a collection of full stack apps to practice integrating the tools and components you learned to use in the Foundations phases. You'll also begin focusing more heavily on code quality and other critical aspects of professional software development.

When you reach Area 45, you'll have the option of jumping right into work on an existing project or defining and working on your own personal project. You'll be able to consult SEPs for guidance around project definition in addition to the broader 1:1 guidance you'll receive from them in your weekly check-ins.

Note that the curriculum is a living, evolving system; it will continue to shift and improve over time.
