# Learning Supports

The Guild is a resource rich environment, offering a mix phase-specific learning supports including lectures, live code reviews, open office hours, and cognitive apprenticeship sessions.

As Learners move from one phase to the next, different kinds of support are needed. Earlier in the program, Learners benefit from highly structured learning content and daily schedules. As you move through the program, your day-to-day work should increasingly simulate that of a real web developer working with a team on real-world applications under the guidance of highly experienced professionals.

Each phase has an assigned Lead serving as the technical “point person” for the duration of a learner’s time in the phase. Some phases also have pro coaches available for support.

**Check the Phase Calendar for your phase for lecture and office hour times.**
