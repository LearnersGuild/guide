# Got Help?

Everyone needs a little help sometimes. In addition to SEP support, there are also Procoaches available to answer questions and help you get unstuck as you go about your daily work. We recommend reaching out for help in the following order:

* Google it - no really, google it and google it again.
* Post a question in the \#Help channel.
* Request help in your phase channel by using the tags below. SEPs and Procoaches assigned to your phase will be pinged. Make sure to include the actual request for help. For example: `@phase-1-help: Can someone explain the difference between mocha and chai?`

#### Phase Help Tags:
