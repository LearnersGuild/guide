# Got Help?

Everyone needs a little help sometimes. In addition to SEP support, there are also Procoaches available to answer questions and help you get unstuck as you go about your daily work. We recommend reaching out for help in the following order:

* Google it - no really, google it and google it again.
* Post a question in the \#Help channel.
* Request help in your phase channel by using the tags below. SEPs and Procoaches assigned to your phase will be pinged. Make sure to include the actual request for help. For example: `@phase-1-help: Can someone explain the difference between mocha and chai?`

#### Phase Help Tags:

```
                @phase-1-help

                @phase-2-help

                @phase-3-help

                @phase-4-help

                @phase-5-help
```

### Recorded Lectures & Office Hour Talks

You can access SEP lectures and office hours on our [YouTube channel. ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC599lkzf-2haPTzDAMGEgLg)

### How do I get clarity on specs that are unclear?

If you're in Phase 3 - Full Stack Projects and you have unclear specs for a project, the first thing to do is ask your teammates. If they cannot help you get the clarity you need then escalate your question to the SEP assigned to your phase.

Once you have the clarification you need. Please suggest a change to improve the goal. Make a pull request either clarifying the specs or asking the goal librarians to clarify them.
