## Four Tribe Agreements

These are the agreements we keep in our daily work and interactions with each other and with our stakeholders in order to care for our Tribe Space.


### Don't triangulate

The intention of this agreement is to build a low-drama, low-politics culture: A team where everyone is confident that they are respected and honored when they're not present.

Don't gossip. Don't build political alliances to get work done. If you mention someone's name when they're not present do it in the same way you would if they were present. If you have feedback for a partner, the best and only place for this feedback is to give it to them directly. If that's not working, get others to join the conversation.

If you have feedback for supporting staff, or other stakeholders, do your best to give it directly to them. If that's not possible/efficient/effective it's OK to talk about them with another partner.

## Five Interpersonal Practices

Our interpersonal practices are aspirational. By definition, we will not do them perfectly, or consistently. Our commitment is to practice, fail, and then return again to the practice. Reminding each other when we forget, and reflecting to each other as we progress.


### Practice Being Real and Vulnerable

We are real with each other. We minimize bullshit and call people on it (kindly).
