# Preparing for the Guild

You've been admitted to a Learners Guild chapter. Your start date is coming up. What should you do to prepare? The answer is unsurprising: **practice, practice, practice**. But not just any old practice, you should be engaging in [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29#Deliberate_practice) and study. \(If you didn't follow that &lt;--- link, stop reading and click on the link. After you geek out on deliberate practice and how great of a developer it will make you, come back and finish reading this section.\)

In this section you'll find recommended laptop specs if you're in the market for a new computer and a checklist of technical resources and exercises to support you in gaining momentum before joining Learners Guild.

Please note that the **Required Prep **below must be completed one** **week before your start date.

You'll also find an overview of how to login and get set up for Slack and Echo - two major tools we use at the Guild daily.

Lastly, you'll find all the details you need for a smooth onboarding process during your first two weeks at the Guild.
