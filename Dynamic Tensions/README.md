# Dynamic Tensions

TODO: Cleanup

A healthy learning collective is a dynamic, evolving, ecosystem. By definition, learning is a growth-oriented endeavor, which means that change and movement are ever present. It also means that the climate must promote aliveness. Growth is an expression of living, as all living things continue to grow. We seek to create the conditions by which rapid, healthy growth can occur, where energy does not stagnate but flows freely in the service of learning, development, and expansion.

In order to create the conditions necessary for life-affirming growth, a learning environment must hold the energy of four dynamic tensions. We strive for an environment that doesn’t trade one quality for the other, but instead holds tension between two sometimes seemingly paradoxical qualities, promoting both.

Each of these tensions can be illustrated by looking at the intersection of each quality:

We support our learning environment by seeding a growth oriented culture that draws out the best in us through the enactment of seemingly paradoxical values that we call Dynamic Tensions. All Guild Members are invited to step into ownership of our culture. it’s vitality depends on it. If we are to achieve our primary objective of creating a dignified livelihood for everyone, then we are all called upon to play in the cultural field on purpose, as our shared purpose.
