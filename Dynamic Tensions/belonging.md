> Genuine democracy is a dynamic tension between self and society, a continual rebalancing and reconstruction that honors both authentic individuality and a common good that asks individuals to look beyond themselves. It is engaged intelligence, not fixed ideology, that enables us to judge how much emphasis to give to one aspect or another in each situation. ~ Dewey

# Belonging Tension: Authentic Individuality <--> Common Wealth / Wellbeing / Good

## Common Good

### Values
- Human Connection: There is a significant and difficult to measure value that comes from human connection and belonging
- Dignity
- Belonging
- Love
- Practice [resisting and overcoming oppression](/Practices/Overcoming_Oppression.md)

### Authentic Individuality
- Wholeness
- Diversity
- Inclusion

## What it could look like

- Aligned incentives
- Flux, dynamism and tension between individual self interest and collective gain
- Minimize self-sacrifice required for collective learning
- Don't sacrifice the collective for the individual
- Resist the urge to choose one side or another
- Dignity is derived from human connection & belonging
- "I can succeed without you. Your success and mine are related and connected."
- "I could learn without you. I learn better with you."

There is a tension between personal freedom and social restraint, but to be in balance we must maintain this tension, knowing that some circumstances call for an emphasis on individuality while in different situations we need to place the good (or the wisdom) of the collective whole above personal desires.

Total individualism views society only as an oppressive force— any collaborative communal endeavor is rejected as a mindless “collectivism.” This is an imbalanced and partial perspective, because many vitally important endeavors require collaborative effort— a generous give and take rather than unyielding self-assertion. But too much emphasis on social, cultural or political unification gives us standardization and technocracy, if not outright dictatorship.
