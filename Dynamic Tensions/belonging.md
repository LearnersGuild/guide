> Genuine democracy is a dynamic tension between self and society, a continual rebalancing and reconstruction that honors both authentic individuality and a common good that asks individuals to look beyond themselves. It is engaged intelligence, not fixed ideology, that enables us to judge how much emphasis to give to one aspect or another in each situation. ~ Dewey

# Belonging Tension: Authentic Individuality <--> Common Wealth / Wellbeing / Good

## Common Good

### Values
- Human Connection: There is a significant and difficult to measure value that comes from human connection and belonging
- Dignity
- Belonging
- Love

### Authentic Individuality
- Wholeness
- Diversity
- Inclusion

## What it could look like

- Aligned incentives
- Flux, dynamism and tension between individual self interest and collective gain
- Minimize self-sacrifice required for collective learning
- Don't sacrifice the collective for the individual
- Resist the urge to choose one side or another
- Dignity is derived from human connection & belonging
- "I can succeed without you. Your success and mine are related and connected."
- "I could learn without you. I learn better with you."

There is a tension between personal freedom and social restraint, but to be in balance we must maintain this tension, knowing that some circumstances call for an emphasis on individuality while in different situations we need to place the good (or the wisdom) of the collective whole above personal desires.

Total individualism views society only as an oppressive force— any collaborative communal endeavor is rejected as a mindless “collectivism.” This is an imbalanced and partial perspective, because many vitally important endeavors require collaborative effort— a generous give and take rather than unyielding self-assertion. But too much emphasis on social, cultural or political unification gives us standardization and technocracy, if not outright dictatorship.

## Practice Resisting and Overcoming Oppression

Because of our collective history and the poor design of the social and economic systems we operate in, the dice are loaded. Racism, sexism, classism, homophobia are some of the many ways there is a systematic imbalance of power and privilege in our society.

If we are to earnestly attempt to fulfill the purpose of "a dignified livelihood for everyone" we need to commit to developing a deep and evolving understanding of how oppression works. In doing this, we need to address how oppression is systemic. More directly, we need to address how we ourselves have been conditioned to be a part of the system: how we might be unconsciously biased, and how we may act or speak in ways that perpetuate oppression.

We can not hope to do our work well if we don't examine ourselves (both individually and as a team) through the lens of our internalized oppression and social privilege. Our identities strongly influence how much power and privilege we are systematically denied or given by society; to have true empathy in a diverse team (and in a diverse organization) requires both self-awareness and social consciousness.

Part of our work is to be aware of our privileges and of the responsibilities that comes with them. Part of our work is to learn to stand fully in our power without shame, guilt, or apology. To learn to leverage this power towards our purpose with humility, gratitude and even joy. To meet the pain and injustice of the situation with compassionate understanding. And to make a fierce commitment to being allies to each other, and to all our stakeholders.
