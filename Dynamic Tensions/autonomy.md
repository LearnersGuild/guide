# Autonomy Tension: Agency <--> Structure

Optimizes the energies between structure and possibility (choice?/freedom? agency?). We believe that a self-directed learning environment is defined by its commitment to maximizing potential within the context of clearly expressed expectations and parameters. We are able experience freedom - the freedom to experiment, the freedom to fail, the freedom to dream - when we can creatively and spontaneously engage with the structures that hold us.

## Agency

### Values
- Autonomy
- Freedom
- Personal Power
- Accountability: Accepting responsibility for my actions. Owning my stuff
- Practice Radical Responsibility: We assume full ownership of our collective purpose and our role(s) in it. We don't blame or avoid. [We own our experience, and our emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk_a2iWWoVQ&feature=youtu.be).


## Structure

### Values
- Clarity: Making what's implicit, explicit
- Integrity: Keeping my word. Practicing the values I profess
- Boundaries: Having good boundaries and honoring others' boundaries




## What could looks like
- I can influence the structures that I am a part of
- As few structures as are needed. No more, no less
- Non prescriptive
- Non coersive structures
- Clear transparent agreements. Shared. Recorded.
- I know my place here, what is expected of me, what I can expect from other people
- There is accountability: people do what they say they are going to do
- There is integrity: if I mess up I follow up on it

What’s possible: An environment with space for improvisation within the (a) structure of integrity is one where I’m truly free, because I know the parameters within which I can play, excel and thrive. No one tells me how to get where I’m going, but I’m clear enough on where I’m going that I can find my own path there. The structure enables me to experiment, to make mistakes, and to expand my sense of what’s possible through spontaneous engagement.

Feels like: I know what’s expected of me, I know what I can expect from others. I feel calm and settled. I know the shared systems we operate by, and the space they allow for flexibility and personalization. Because of this combination of clarity and autonomy, I feel on purpose, productive, and independent.

Looks like: People are firm with their tensions, flexible with their solutions. Very little time is wasted negotiating how to be together in the space (i.e. “how we get things done”) - the expectations and boundaries are clear, and they are spacious enough to allow for great freedom of movement within structure. People can make proposals to impact how things are run - the process of making these changes is clear - improvisation with integrity
