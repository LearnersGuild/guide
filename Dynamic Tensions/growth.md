# Growth Tension: Safety <--> Truth

We hold the fundamental belief that all people can learn and grow, and are driven by a deep desire to do so.

Everyone at Learners Guild makes a commitment to their own personal development. They also make a commitment to the personal growth of others. We do this as a necessary means of achieving the highest business outcomes, and as an end in itself.

We are in the learning business. Learning is the process of acting on our curiosity, receiving feedback, integrating it, and reflecting on it. In working together, we are animated by:


## Safety

### Values
- Kindness: We treat ourselves and others with dignity, respect and an open heart. We assume good intentions and give others the benefit of doubt.
- Appreciation: Seeing and reflecting the best in others
- Vulnerability: Choosing to be impacted by someone else's truth and being committed to [putting down our defenses/reactions/shame and to being touched/moved](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en).


## Truth

### Values
- Honesty: Speaking my truth clearly and authentically.
- Courage: Choosing courage over comfort
- Transparency & Openness
- Continuous feedback

First: **A genuine love for and pursuit of truth**

  We deliberately remove obstacles to truth telling. We welcome mistakes as long as there is authentic and vulnerable reflection as well as personal responsibility. We are 100% transparent to each other and our stakeholders, and as open as we can be to the public without compromising our purpose (for example, we might choose to keep a certain expansion plan private from the public in order to maintain a competitive advantage in a new market).



### Building Trust with Truth

Communication and negotiation among groups of people is difficult, but the more honest we can be with each other, the easier it will be for us to trust one another and work together as a team. Openness and honesty will be critical to our success, which is why this is one of our key values, and why it’s a mantra we repeat in many conversations.

The best way for you to make a decision about what’s good for Learners Guild is to have all of the information about what’s going on at Learners Guild. The same is true for everyone else you work with, so it’s important that we’re all up to date about what’s happening, even with the areas of Learners Guild that we’re not actively involved with.

Transparency may seem like a passive process, like "don’t hide anything," but it’s actually a big challenge to keep everyone up to date and on the same page about stuff they’re not working on on a daily basis, even for a company the size of Learners Guild. These are some of the policies we use to make information more accessible, but our work is ongoing.

### Partner-to-Partner Feedback

Feedback given from one partner to another is private unless the partner receiving the feedback wishes to share.

Giving and receiving feedback is an integral part of working at Learners Guild. We acknowledge that in order for us all to continuously grow, we need to be able to give and receive feedback on things that push the edges of our comfort zones. Feedback is vulnerable and thus should be respectful and private.

Partners are, of course, encouraged to share as much of their _received_ feedback as they wish, whether to seek support or to stay in integrity.

### Private Information: When and why information should be private

Choose to make information private if:

- making it transparent could damage the purpose of the organization
- you do not own the information and do not have the owner's explicit permission to make it transparent
- the information directly concerns another partner and you do not have their explicit permission to make it transparent


### Closing the Gaps

In a typical organization, individuals expend enormous energy protecting themselves. People hide parts of themselves, avoid conflict, unwittingly sabotage change efforts, and subtly enforce a separation between “the me at work” and the “real me”. The consequences are all too common, and all too familiar: more stress and turnover, office politics and gossip, less engagement and collaboration, and ultimately worse outcomes.

“Gaps” in organizations, in this sense, are most often defined by the conversations we’re not having, the things we’re not discussing, the synchronicities with others that we are not achieving, and the work that, because of some self-protective fear, we are avoiding.[^1]

#### Gaps may arise between:

* what we do and what we say
* what we feel and what we say
* the water cooler conversation and the meeting room conversation
* the real-time occasion of performance and the feedback on performance
* knowledge of our principles and the application of those principles
* observations perceived and feedback given
* unacknowledged power dynamics
* unresolved interpersonal tensions
* what is discussed at a board or 'executive' level and what is shared with staff

We acknowledge that these gaps exist, and we are dedicated to closing them.

We are inspired by efforts like those of Chris Argyris, who recognized the existence of these gaps as a prime hindrance to organizational effectiveness and even learning in the specific. We will work to create easily learnable methods that help individuals communicate in ways that don’t arouse defensive reactions in others, and that enable individuals to receive and integrate feedback.[^2]
