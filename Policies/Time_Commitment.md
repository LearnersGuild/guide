# Time Commitment

While our ambition is to be able to invest in everyone who aspires to be a software developer, we are still a long way from being there. For now, we can only invest in learners whose life circumstances afford them the privilege of reliably being able to show up at the office every weekday \(except [national holidays](../General/Holiday_List.md)\) from **9:00 AM to 6:00 PM**. 

Make sure to read the Time Commitment Policy closely. **Abiding by this policy is a condition for continued membership at the Guild.** 


### Personal Days

Life happens to all of us, so we make an allowance of **10 personal days** over the course of the 40 weeks.

You can use personal days at your discretion. Use them for physical or mental health days, emergency errands, major life events (births/bereavement/weddings) or anything else you think is important enough to warrant your absence.

Personal days are used in increments of half days \(4 hours\). If you have to miss more than an hour \(up to 4 hours\), you'd use a half day, anything over 4 hours would be a full day. For example, if you need to leave at 4pm for a doctor's appointment, you'd take half a personal day. If you need to be absent for 6 hours, then you need to take a whole personal day off. If you are absent for more than ten days, it will prompt a conversation with your Learning Facilitator about your commitment at the Guild. Depending on the outcome of this conversation, the Guild's investment in you may be paused or cancelled.

When you decide to take a personal day you must email **[timeoff@learnersguild.org][email-timeoff]** with the number of days and dates of your absence. You must also and post in your phase and house channels on Slack to let your colleagues know you'll be out.


### Professional Development Days

Every learner has 3 days Professional Development (PD) days to support you in your growth as a web developer. 

PD days are distinct from Personal Days. PDs are for expanding your learning at a conference or workshop, while Personal Days are, well, other stuff (doctor's appointments, weddings, mental health day, etc.).

### Job Interviews
Towards the end of your time at the Guild, you may need to be absent for on-site interviews. Hours spent at on-site interviews do not count towards your 10 personal days. You should still notify the other learners in your phase and in your house before taking time off for an interview. **To be clear, you do not need to notify [timeoff@learnersguild.org][email-timeoff]**. Just let the rest of us know so we can cheer you on.

### No Call, No Show
If you are late or absent and do not let anyone know via Slack or by emailing [timeoff@learnersguild.org][email-timeoff], it will be considered a _“no call, no show.”_ No call, no shows are a serious violation of our time commitment policy, akin to not showing up to work. You must post in Slack and/or email timeoff as soon as you know you will be late or absent - in 95% of cases, this means posting or emailing before you miss the time. **5 consecutive No call, No show instances may result in the immediate withdrawal of our investment and termination of your membership at the Guild.** 

## Leave of Absence Policy

Under extenuating circumstances (e.g. serious illness, family emergency), learners may request a leave of absence from the program. Leaves of absence (LOA) are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may last up to 3 months. While you're away, your phase progression is "frozen." Upon your return your phase progression will be reactivated and you will have however many weeks left in the phase you had prior to leaving. For example, if you just completed the fourth week of Phase 2 when you left, upon your return you will begin week 5 in the phase.    

If you are gone for a full 3 month period and there are significant curriculum changes you will be resorted into the appropriate phase upon your return.

If you need to request a Leave of Absence, contact your Learning Facilitator via Slack to initiate this process.    You may be required to present medical documentation for LOA approval.  


## Common Questions

#### What happens if I come late or need to leave early?

Your commitment is to show up and practice web development between 9:00am to 6pm. Anything non-critical to your life should be scheduled outside these hours.

If you are going to be late and/or miss a day, you need to let your colleagues by posting in your Phase channel, and emailing **[timeoff@learnersguild.org][email-timeoff]**, if you are taking a personal or PD day.

You must also inform anyone you have meetings scheduled with for the day (SEPs, Procoaches, Learning Facilitators, house members, etc.), as you would in the workplace. Informing your colleagues about your inability to be present and logging time off are agreements we make to respect each others' and our communal time. 

#### What if I get sick?

Use a personal day, stay home, and get better. When you wake up with that stuffy nose, or fever, grab your phone or laptop, hop on Slack and let everyone in your phase and house know you'll be out for the day. Then send a quick email to **[timeoff@learnersguild.org][email-timeoff]** indicating the date you will be absent.

#### Can I stay late and work at the office on weekends?

Yes. You can use the space during [open hours](../Oakland_Building.md#hours). No staff will be on-site outside of regular hours.

That being said, we strongly recommend that you get rest, exercise, and otherwise take care of yourself! Your mind and body need breaks to sustain the prolonged learning effort.
