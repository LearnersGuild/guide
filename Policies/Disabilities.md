**Procedure for Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Learners with Disabilities**


1. Make the request – you do not have to disclose a disability or diagnosis or reference a “reasonable accommodation,” just make the request. Fill out the [Request for Accommodation Form](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5hLsmJLYceldHU3ZjMtcmx6VG8), sign it, and email it to accommodations@learnersguild.org. If you would like support in filling out the form or understanding the process, please do not hesitate to reach out to a Learning Facilitator or other Learners Guild staff. However, a conversation with a Learning Facilitator or other Learners Guild staff does not serve as a request for accommodations.

2. Based on the request (if it’s not obvious to us what the limitations are or we need more information about the limitations), we may require a Medical Release Form, and a Medical Certification Form.

3. In applicable situations, we begin an interactive process of determining whether, and how, we can meet the request. This may involve meetings, consultations, suggestions of alternative methods, or anything else that reaches the goal of reasonable accommodation balanced against undue hardship to Learners Guild.


*Every circumstance is unique. Learners Guild will process each request individually.Learners with disabilities required under applicable law may request reasonable accommodations at any time. Receipt or denial of one request does not prevent a Learner from making a request later – circumstances may change for the Learner or for The Guild, and each request will be processed according to what is reasonable and feasible in that situation at that time, in accordance with applicable law.*
