# Policies

We only have a few policies and they’re applicable chapter-wide. We’ve kept it simple for a few reasons: policies are the most “expensive” agreements to change, often requiring the most work to revise or scrap. They’re also pretty reactionary and limit our ability to
creatively problem solve and respond to new situations, eventually creating more challenges than they solve.

The policies we have so far are meant to keep us safe, comfortable and promote inclusion. Pretty basic, but essential stuff. There are some policies that are outside of learner modification, but that doesn’t mean we’re not open to hearing your ideas and/or feedback about them. For example, we’re willing to hear feedback about the ISA, but the policies that make up the ISA cannot be directly modified by learners.

This the list of Policies that Learners Guild members need to abide by in order to continue to be a part of our collective
