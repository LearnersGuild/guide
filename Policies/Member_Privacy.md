# Member Privacy

## Learning Space Privacy

**As an Educational Institution, it is Learners Guild’s goal to monitor or track our members in as few ways as possible.** We want Learners Guild members to feel a sense of ownership towards their personal workspaces and be comfortable at the office. However, in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Learners Guild members, company property (e.g. desks, laptops, and other devices) is subject to search. For instance, this might be used if management learns that a learner has brought a gun to work or has stolen company property.

This means that while the company will always try to respect member privacy, members do not have a right to privacy in their workspaces in any property that belongs to Learners Guild. Learners Guild reserves the right to search company property at any time, without warning, to ensure compliance with our policies, including those that cover member safety, workplace violence, harassment, theft, and possession of prohibited items. If you use a lock on any item of company property, you must give a copy of the key or combination to a staff member.

## Email and Internet Privacy

Learners Guild email and Internet are not being actively monitored by anyone, but because they are company resources that are managed according to company policy, you should not expect privacy from either. The company has both the ability and the right to look at member usage for both in order to protect member safety and wellbeing, as well as company property and interests.

## All Conduct Rules Apply to Email and Chat

All of our policies and rules of conduct apply to member use of the email system. This means, for example, that you may not use the email system to send harassing or discriminatory messages, including messages with explicit sexual content or pornographic images; to send threatening messages; or to reveal company trade secrets.

## Email Security

To avoid email viruses, phishing for account information, and other threats, members should not open email attachments from people and businesses they don’t recognize, particularly if the email appears to have been forwarded multiple times or has a nonexistent or peculiar subject heading. Even if you know the sender, do not open an email attachment that has a strange name or is not referenced in the body of the email; it may have been transmitted automatically, without the sender’s knowledge.

If you believe your computer has been infected by a virus, worm, or other security threat to Learners Guild’s system, you must inform the founders immediately.

Members may not share their email passwords with anyone, including coworkers or family members. Revealing passwords to the Company’s email system could allow an outsider to attack the Learners Guild network

## Internet Use Is Not Private

We reserve the right to monitor member use of the Internet at any time. You should not expect that your use of the Internet—including but not limited to the sites you visit, the amount of time you spend online, and the communications you have—will be private.
