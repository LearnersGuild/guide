# Complaint Policy

Learners Guild is committed to creating a safe learning environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the people who work here. That includes (but isn't limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

Learners Guild has an open-door policy, so members are encouraged to report work/learning-related concerns. If something about the environment is bothering you, or if you have a related question, concern, idea, or problem, please discuss it with an LG staff member as soon as possible.

Any member who witnesses or is subject to inappropriate conduct in the workplace should report it to Complaints (complaints@learnersguild.org).

We encourage members to come forward with any complaint about our learning environment, even if it's not about something that's explicitly covered in our written policies.

Once a complaint has been made, the our staff will determine how to handle it.

# Complaints about the founder

Currently, Learners Guild is too small to have an internal group or department  that can independently respond to complaints, so if the founder is named in complaints, the board will be responsible to holding him accountable.  Where appropriate, they will engage a third party to conduct a thorough investigation and recommend corrective action, where necessary.

If the founder is the subject of the complaint, please report it to the Learners Guild board - founder-complaint@learnersguild.org (this email goes to all board members except the founder). We will conduct a complete an impartial investigation, which may involve an outside investigator in serious cases. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible. When the investigation is complete, the company will take corrective action if appropriate.

# No retaliation

We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any member who makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the conduct immediately to the founder (or founder-complaint@learnersguild.org in case the complaint involved the founder).
