# Stats

These statistics (stats) are meant to reflect your progress towards the [game objectives][game-objectives], as well as your overall "health" in the game.

At the end of every project, the data gathered in the reflection phase is used to calculate and update your player stats.

## XP

Your experience, aggregated and condensed to a number. XP always grows; the larger the number, the higher your experience. XP is calculated by combining the following for each project worked on:

- Your percentage contribution to the project
- Total hours worked on the project by all team members
- Project quality
- Project completeness

## Average Project Completeness

The average % completion of all projects you've worked on.

## Average Project Quality

The average % quality of all projects you've worked on.

## Learning Support

How much your team members felt that you supported them in their learning. This is a weighted average with more recent projects counting more than earlier ones. Represented as a percentage (0-100%).

## Culture Contribution

How much your team members felt you contributed positively to the team culture. This is a weighted average with more recent projects counting more than earlier ones. Represented as a percentage (0-100%).

## Discernment

Reflects the degree to which you are biased in your assessment of your contribution to projects (as compared to the average of others' assessment). Represented as a percentage corresponding to the average of how much you over- or under-estimate your contribution to projects.

Zero is equal to perfect discernment (i.e. you estimate your contribution the same as your peers do). The closer this stat is to zero, the more accurate your discernment is.

## Time Dedication per Week

Average hours per week you spent contributing to team projects.
