# Stats

These statistics (stats) are meant to reflect your progress towards the [game objectives][game-objectives], as well as your overall "health" in the game.

At the end of every project, the data gathered in the reflection phase is used to calculate and update your player stats.

## XP

Your experience, aggregated and condensed to a number. XP always grows; the larger the number, the higher your experience. XP is calculated by combining:

- Your percentage contribution to projects
- Total hours worked on the project by all team members
- Project quality
- Project completeness

## Learning Support

How much your team members felt that you supported them in their learning. This is a weighted average with more recent projects counting more than earlier ones. Represented as a percentage (0-100%).

## Culture Contribution

How much your team members felt you contributed positively to the team culture. This is a weighted average with more recent projects counting more than earlier ones. Represented as a percentage (0-100%).

## Discernment

Reflects the degree to which you are biased in your assessment of yourself and others (as compared to the average of others' assessment). Represented as a positive or negative percentage, corresponding to your tendency to over- or under-estimate your own contribution. The closer this stat is to zero, the more accurate your discernment is.

## Time Dedication per Week
