# Membership Review

Learners who do not meet the [membership expectations](./Membership_Expectations.md) will be subject to a membership re-evaluation, and possible termination of membership.

## Membership Re-Evaluation

The purpose of the membership re-evaluation is for **the Moderator to decide on whether or not the Guild is still a good fit for the learner, and whether or not it should continue to invest in them**.

Once a re-evaluation has been kicked off, the moderator will ask SEPs and Learning Facilitators for feedback to help inform their decision. In addition, they will use the following sources of information to inform their decision (in this order):

- An in depth conversation with the learner about what expectations weren't met and why
- Data about their progress (and pace) as web developers
- Data about their team and culture play from retrospectives
- Data about broken agreements

After the Membership Re-Evaluation, the moderator may decide to ask the learner to leave, or come to an agreed course of action that corrects the missed expectations and schedule another Membership Re-Evaluation a few weeks out.

### A note about Membership Re-Evaluations

The point of these evaluations is *to determine whether the learning model and culture at the Guild are enabling a learner to make meaningful progress towards their goal of becoming a web developer, while supporting others in doing the same*

You will only be asked to leave if you consistently underperform and show no signs of improvement. A thriving learning community requires the effort and engagement from everyone involved; without that, the whole collective will fail.

## Reasons for Terminating Membership

**The Learning Operating System and Cultural Operating System will not work for all learners. In cases where there are indicators that the structures and systems at the Guild may not be working for a member, the moderator will initiate an Membership Re-Evaluation.** The Moderator (shereef) will start an Membership Re-Evaluation with a Guild Member in one of three cases:

### 1. Poor Learning model fit (Objective 1):

The learning model at the Guild may not support everyone in their learning. Moderator will be looking out for the following indicators that a learner is not making progress through the structures and learning model at the Guild:

- Data about their progress (and pace) as web developers
- Completeness of the projects they were on
- Relative contribution to the projects they were on
- Qualitative and quantitative feedback from the retros
- Estimation Accuracy/Bias, Review Accuracy
- The learner's own self reports that the Guild isn't working for them and a learner facilitator agrees.

### 2. Poor Culture fit (Objective 2):

Our second objective is to co-create a learning culture that brings out the best in ourselves and each other. Moderator will look at the following indicators to determine whether a learner is unable to constructively work with others and co-create the Guild learning culture:

- Data about their team and culture play from retrospectives

### 3. Learner is out of integrity

Moderator will look at these indicators to determine if a learner is consistently breaking agreements with the guild and/or other members:

- Number and nature of broken agreements logged by staff (a broken agreement that a staff person noticed, and told the learner about)
- Number of retrospectives missed, project reviews missed...etc.
- Number of personal days taken v.s. number of weeks left
- Number of no show, no call
- Copying code from previous solutions

### What will NOT be used to kick off an Membership Re-Evaluation

- Feedback from Learning Facilitators or SEPs
- Feedback from other learners
- Any information/data from the therapist
