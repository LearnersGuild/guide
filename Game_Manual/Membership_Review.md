# Membership Review

Learners who do not meet the [membership expectations](./Membership_Expectations.md) will go through a membership re-evaluation, and possible termination of membership. The purpose of the membership re-evaluation is for **the Guild to decide on whether or not the it's still a good fit for the learner, and whether or not it should continue to invest in them**.

Once a review has been kicked off, an SEP and a Learning Facilitator will be asked to weigh in on wether or not the learner is a good fit for the guild.

## Step 1: Evaluation

### Technical Fit and Accountability

The SEP will look at the learner's data to evaluate their skill and the degree to which they kept their technical agreements. They will look at the following:

- How is their ELO compared to start date?
- How is their Level compared to start date?
- How have they done on previous solo goals?
- Have they shipped code and contributed to it?
- Too much solo? Too much pairing?
- Too many repeating goals?
- Estimation bias / accuracy
- Review accuracy
- Unset artifacts
- Unfilled retros

Based on this data, they'll give a thumbs up, thumbs down, or sideways.

### Culture Fit and Accountability

A Learning Facilitator will look at the learner's data to evaluate their culture contribution, coachability, and the degree to which they kept their non-technical agreements. They will look at the following:

- Quality of peer Feedback they received
- Quality of peer feedback they gave
- Quality of coach feedback they gave
- Number, frequency and magnitude of broken agreements
- Previous history of demonstrating coachability

Based on this data, they'll give a thumbs up, thumbs down, or sideways.

## Step 2: Next Step

Based on the results of the evaluation, the next step is decided

| Technical | Culture | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| Thumbs UP | Thumbs UP | End Review |
| Thumbs UP | Sideways  | End Review |
| Sideways | Thumbs UP | End Review |
| Sideways | Sideways | SEP & LF Interview |
| Thumbs Down | Thumbs UP | SEP Interview |
| Thumbs UP | Thumbs Down | LF Interview |
| Thumbs Down | Sideways | SEP Interview |
| Sideways | Thumbs Down | LF Interview |
| Thumbs Down | Thumbs Down | Membership Cancelled |


## Step 3: Interview

If the learner receives at least one thumbs down, or two sideways, then the SEP or LF (or both) will interview them. The interview is a deeper dive were any of the following will be explored:

- the reasons for broken agreements (temporary or systemic)
- coachability
- technical skill
- learning model fit

After the review, the guild may ask the learner to leave, or come to an agreed course of action that corrects the missed expectations and schedule another membership review a few weeks out.

### What will NOT be used as part of a Membership Review

- Any information/data from the therapist (staff never talks to the therapists about specific learners)

### A note about Membership Re-Evaluations

The point of these evaluations is *to determine whether the learning model and culture at the Guild are enabling a learner to make meaningful progress towards their goal of becoming a web developer, while supporting others in doing the same*

You will only be asked to leave if you consistently underperform and show no signs of improvement. A thriving learning community requires the effort and engagement from everyone involved; without that, the whole collective will fail.
