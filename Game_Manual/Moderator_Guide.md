# Moderator Guide

Moderators act as referee and game master; they help ensure proper structure and pacing. In addition, they aid learners in understanding how to play most effectively.

Orienting learners to the systems, structures, and processes of the game is usually done in the first days of gameplay. Use this guide as a script for orientations.
