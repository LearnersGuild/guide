# Cognitive Apprenticeship

The Learning Operating System (LOS, for short) at Learners Guild uses a mechanic called cognitive apprenticeship.

Cognitive Apprenticeship is a method for transferring knowledge and skills from one person to another. It is based on the simple idea that humans learn from observing each other, immitating each other, and then trying to innovate or improve on what they see others doing.

### Apprenticeship

Professional apprenticeships have been around for a while. They usually include an experienced professional (called a practitioner or craftperson) and one or more learners who have less, little, or no experience in the craft being studied.

Unlike a classroom or lecture hall, an apprenticeship focuses on the doing of work as opposed to the explaining of concepts. Rather than telling you how things work, the practitioner in an apprenticeship will show you how *they* make things work, and they will call on you, not to answer questions, but to perform tasks that they believe you are ready to perform.

The goal of an apprenticeship is for you to learn by observing and doing actual work alongside a more experienced practitioner. It is meant to be a collaborative and constructive way to learn a new craft.

### Why *Cognitive* Apprenticeship?

Learners Guild uses a special type of apprenticeship called Cognitive Apprenticeship. Cognitive Apprenticeship uses a specific set of practices or habits to help accelerate the transfer of expertise that is hard to see, hear, or observe directly. Cognitive Apprenticeship patterns of behavior allow learners to more easily identify the mental efforts being made by more experienced practitioners. These behaviors and patterns of interaction also help practitioners share their expertise in a way that makes their wisdom and experience more accessible to others. 

Whenever you are learning a highly thoughtful craft (ex: software development) where most of the work is done within the human brain/body (as opposed to being performed on an object, like a football or a piano) Cognitive Apprenticeship is a powerful tool to get the most out of working with people who are more or less experienced than you. In fact, it has been shown to help experienced practitioners learn more about how they themselves practice their craft, and how they can do it even better.

Because everyone, regardless of experience, can learn from and with each other by engaging in a Cognitive Apprenticeship, Learners Guild believes it is one of the most dignified ways to learn a valued craft like Software Development. It's also quite simple.

### The practice of Cognitive Apprenticeship

Cognitive Apprenticeship can be practiced by moving sequencially and repeatedly through three states of mind.

Preparation -> Observation -> Reflection

##### Preparation

Both experienced Practitioners and Learners must prepare to do work together. At Learners Guild, the preparation phase of Cognitive Apprenticeship occurs during Goal Selection, Project Formation, and the Project Kickoff. The goal of the preparation phase is for both Pracititioner and Learner to make themselves ready for the work that will be performed on the chosen project.

*Questions to answer during the preparation phase* 

1. *The Who* Who will be the Practitioner that will perform the work on this goal or task? Who will be the Learner(s) that will observe?
2. *The When and Where* When will the Practitioner and the Learner(s) meet? What tools and/or environment will be needed to perform and observe the task?
3. *The What* What specific goal will be efforted? What reading, studying, practicing, or other preparation must the Practitioner do to attempt the goal? What reading, studying, practicing, or other preparation must be done by the learner(s) to be capable of observing the practitioner work on this particular goal?

##### Observation

The observation phase could also be referred to as the "working" phase. It's where the goal is efforted, the task performed, the work is done. The difference here, is that instead of just doing work, both the Practitioner and the Learner(s) do specific things that make the expertise being performed more observable by all participants.

*Behaviors to apply to the observation phase*

*Learner Behaviors*

1. Immediately before observing a Practitioner perform a task, prepare to take notes and record questions and thoughts based on what you expect to be looking for.
2. While observing a Practitioner perform a task, continuously try to deduce the approach and the perspective they are using to complete the task.
3. During the observation phase, avoid asking questions that might interupt the Practitioner, ask clarifying questions only.
4. When an observation phase lasts longer than 60 minutes, ask to take a break and do a brief review before continuing to observe.

*Practitioner Behaviors*

1. Immediately before beginning to work on a task, prime the Learner to take notes and record questions/thoughts based on what you expect them to be looking for.
2. While performing a task, verbalize your thoughts out loud as much as you can. BUT DO NOT TEACH! DO NOT INSTRUCT! DO NOT TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
3. During the observation phase, avoid instructing or telling the Learner what to do or what you're doing, demonstrate what to do instead.
4. When the task being performed during an observation phase lasts more than 60 minutes, take a break and do a brief review with the Learner(s) before continuing.
