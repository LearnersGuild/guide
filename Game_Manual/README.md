# Game Manual

The Learning Operating System (LOS, for short) is a game-enhanced learning environment for engaging in cognitive apprenticeship.

In other words, it's a **game** for **learning** a **craft**.

The primary interface for engaging with the LOS is through [Echo][echo]. Here learners can communicate, collaborate, and [run commands][commands] to interact with the game.

You'll learn a lot about how the game works just by asking questions in Slack and talking with your fellow learners. Use this manual as a reference and a guide to the game.

- To get your bearings, read about [Basic Gameplay][basic-gameplay].
- To learn how to find the right level of challenge for your learning, read [Challenge][challenge].
- To find out about the levels of advancement and game roles, read [Levels and Roles][levels-roles].
- To better understand what cognitive apprenticeship is and how to use it, read [Cognitive Apprenticeship][cog-app].
- To find out how your stats are calculated, read [Stats][stats].
- To understand what is expected of all members and how membership can be cancelled when these expectations are not met, read [Membership Expectations][member-expectations] and [Membership Review][member-review].

We've designed this game to help you learn through cognitive apprenticeship as best as possible. It is by no means a finished product and is currently under active development.

If you notice something that could be better, or you encounter a bug, please log them in the [LOS repo][los-repo]. We want your feedback. Together we can build a more perfect Learning Operating System.
