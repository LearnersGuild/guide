# Game Manual

The Learning Operating System (LOS, for short) is a game-enhanced learning environment for engaging in cognitive apprenticeship.

In other words, it's a **game** for **learning** a **craft**.

The primary interface for engaging with the LOS is through [Echo][echo]. Here learners can communicate, collaborate, and [run commands][commands] to interact with the game.

You'll learn a lot about how the game works just by asking questions in Echo and talking with your fellow learners. Use this manual as a reference and a guide to the game.

To get your bearings, read about [Basic Gameplay][basic-gameplay].

We've designed this game to help you learn through cognitive apprenticeship as best as possible. It is by no means a finished product and is currently under active development.

If you notice something that could be better, or you encounter a bug, please log them in the [LOS repo][los-repo]. We want your feedback. Together we can build a more perfect Learning Operating System.
