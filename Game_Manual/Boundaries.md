# Game Boundaries

The boundaries of the game define its edges: what the objective is, and how a player succeeds or fails.

It is important to note that the game is _not_ zero-sum: one player winning does not mean another loses. It is a multiplayer cooperative game where each player's success is interconnected to and supported by other players' successes.

## Objectives

The game is designed to support players in tracking and achieving two objectives:

1. To become a world class beginner in their craft
1. To co-create a culture of collective learning

## Success Conditions

A player succeeds when they (a) meet the above objectives and (b) fulfill the obligations in their contract.

At this point, they are ready to pursue their craft as a practitioner and no longer need the support and scaffolding the game provides.

## Fail Conditions

A player fails the game if their [stats][stats] show them to be consistently underperforming.

Fail conditions are triggered when any of the following persists over multiple cycles:

1. Rate of [XP][xp] growth is too low
1. [Learning Support][learning-support] is too low
1. [Culture Contribution][culture-contribution] is too low
1. [Estimation Accuracy][estimation-accuracy] is too high

If fail conditions are met, the Moderator will ask the player to leave the game.

_For now, since we have very little historical data tracking stats, "too high" and "too low" are the best we can do in defining these stat thresholds. It's up to the Moderator to decide what the thresholds are for each stat and to communicate these thresholds to the players._
