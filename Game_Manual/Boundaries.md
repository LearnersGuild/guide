# Guild Boundaries

## Objectives

The Guild is designed to support members in tracking and achieving two objectives:

1. To become a world class beginner in their craft (Full Stack Javascript Web Development)
1. To co-create a culture of collective learning

## Basic Expectations

The Guild expects the learner to have the ability to…

- work on projects collaboratively in-person 8:30-6:00pm Monday – Friday
- work in teams of 2 or more on collaborative projects
- participate fully in the structures of the learning operating system and cultural operating system, which consist of:
  - Voting on weekly projects
  - Working collaboratively to complete weekly projects
  - Submitting weekly retrospectives
  - Reviewing projects (when appropriate for their level)
  - Attending COS Foundations Workshops
  - Attending weekly Learner Support Group (LSG) meetings
- abide by all policies, space agreements, and culture agreements
- work in open floor plan arrangement with large group of people and varying noise levels
- demonstrate responsiveness to feedback about social skills (from staff and from peer evaluations)

In addition to the above basic requirements, learners are expected to progress at a certain pace. This will be reflected through their stats (gaining XP and leveling up).

## Terminating Membership

**The Learning Operating System and Cultural Operating System will not work for all learners. In cases where there are indicators that the structures and systems at the Guild may not be working for a member, the moderator will initiate an Investment Re-Evaluation.** The Moderator (shereef) will start an Investment Re-Evaluation with a Guild Member in one of three cases:

### 1. Poor Learning model fit (Objective 1):

The learning model at the Guild may not support everyone in their learning. Moderator will be looking out for the following indicators that a learner is not making progress through the structures and learning model at the Guild:

- Data about their progress (and pace) as web developers
- Quality and Completeness of the projects they were on
- Relative contribution to the projects they were on
- Qualitative and quantitative feedback from the retros
- Estimation Accuracy/Bias, Review Accuracy
- The learner's own self reports that the Guild isn't working for them and a learner facilitator agrees.

### 2. Poor Culture fit (Objective 2):

Our second objective is to co-create a learning culture that brings out the best in ourselves and each other. Moderator will look at the following indicators to determine whether a learner is unable to constructively work with others and co-create the Guild learning culture:

- Data about their team and culture play from retrospectives

### 3. Learner is out of integrity

Moderator will look at these indicators to determine if a learner is consistently breaking agreements with the guild and/or other members:

- Number and nature of broken agreements logged by staff (a broken agreement that a staff person noticed, and told the learner about)
- Number of retrospectives missed, project reviews missed...etc.
- Number of personal days taken v.s. number of weeks left
- Number of no show, no call
- Copying code from previous solutions

### What will NOT be used to kick off an Investment Re-Evaluation

- Feedback from Learning Facilitators or SEPs
- Feedback from other learners
- Any information/data from the therapist

## Investment Re-Evaluation

The purpose of the investment re-evaluation is for **the Moderator to decide on wether or not the Guild is still a good fit for the learner, and wether or not it should continue to invest in them**.

Once a re-evaluation has been kicked off, the moderator will ask SEPs and Learning Facilitators for feedback to help inform their decision. In addition, they will use the following sources of information to inform their decision (in this order):

- An in depth conversation with the learner about what expectations weren't met and why
- Data about their progress (and pace) as web developers
- Data about their team and culture play from retrospectives
- Data about broken agreements


After the Investment Re-Evaluation, the moderator may decide to ask the learner to leave, or come to an agreed course of action that corrects the missed expectations and schedule another Investment Re-Evaluation a few weeks out.


### A note about Investment Re-Evaluations

The point of these evaluations is to ensure that all learners in the collective are contributing fairly to their teams.

You will only be asked to leave if you consistently underperform and show no signs of improvement. A thriving learning community requires the effort and engagement from everyone involved; without that, the whole collective will fail.


## The Laws of Integrity and of No Collusion

For the most part, the progression of the learner is reflected by stats: the better a someone's stats are, the better they are doing.

In order for this to work, however, everyone must follow two laws: the Law of Integrity and the Law of No Collusion.

The Law of Integrity is as follows:

> Players must be as honest and truthful as possible when reporting data.

For example, a player would be breaking the Law of Integrity if they report that they worked 40 hours on a project when they know that they only worked 20.

Much of the data requested is subjective, which is why the law only says "as truthful as possible". Absolute truth is not expected, but players are expected to not willfully distort the truth.

The Law of No Collusion take the Law of Integrity to the group level:

> Players must not conspire with other players to sabotage procedures.

For example, a player would be breaking this law if they made a pact with other players to vote for or against a particular goal.

Players can try to persuade and influence each other in game procedures like voting and project reviews, but they may not collude to ensure a particular outcome.

It's fine (even encouraged) for players to discuss and debate the meaning of the stats:
- "How do we define measure project quality?"
- "What matters to you when determining culture contribution?"
- "What do you take into account when determining percentage contribution?"

The Law of Collusion forbids players from discussing **actual numbers**. For example:
- "I'm thinking I did about a third of this project? What do you guys think?"
- "It seems to me that our project quality is at 80%. That's what I'm going to say in my review."

If these laws are upheld, then the stats maintains their integrity; and are not corrupted.

If these laws are broken, that will lead to an investor re-evaluation.
