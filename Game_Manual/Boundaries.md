# Game Boundaries

The boundaries of the game define its edges: what the objective is, and how a player succeeds or fails.

It is important to note that the game is _not_ zero-sum: one player winning does not mean another loses. It is a multiplayer cooperative game where each player's success is interconnected to and supported by other players' successes.

## Objectives

The game is designed to support players in tracking and achieving two objectives:

1. To become a world class beginner in their craft
1. To co-create a culture of collective learning

## Success Conditions

A player succeeds when they (a) meet the above objectives and (b) fulfill the obligations in their contract.

At this point, they are ready to pursue their craft as a practitioner and no longer need the support and scaffolding the game provides.

## Fail Conditions

A player is at risk of failing the game if their [stats][stats] show them to be consistently underperforming.

There are two stages of failing.

The first stage starts when a player's stats go _in the red_. When a stat **falls below** any of the following thresholds, it is in the red:

- [Health: Team Play][team-play] : 65%
- [Health: Culture Contribution][culture-contribution] : 65%
- [XP][xp] earned per cycle : 17.5

Once a stat is in the red, the player has to **consistently improve** their affected stats until they are above the threshold. If you have a stat in the red, get whatever support you need to move the needle and get out of danger.

When you have a stat in the red, you have to show continuous progress. This doesn't mean that every week has to be higher than the previous week. It means that every week's stats has to be higher than than _two_ weeks ago until you get above the threshold.

> If you are in the red, and your end of cycle stats are lower than what they were two cycles ago, you get an exit interview.

The second stage is an _exit interview_, and is entered into when a player's stats have _both_:

1. been in the red for at least two weeks and
1. have not shown consistent improvement

During the exit interview, the player will meet with a moderator to discuss their performance and whether or not they can continue in the game.

### A note about fail conditions

The point of these fail conditions is to ensure that all learners in the collective are contributing fairly to their teams.

If one or more of your stats falls in the red, think of it as a useful warning to help you get back on track. Then figure out how to improve your stats (hint: you may want to get support and/or more feedback).

You will only be asked to leave if you consistently underperform and show no signs of improvement. A thriving learning community requires the effort and engagement from everyone involved; without that, the whole collective will fail.

## The Laws of Integrity and of No Collusion

For the most part, the rules of the game are dictated by stats: the better a player's stats are, the better they are doing in the game.

In order for this to work, however, all players must follow two laws: the Law of Integrity and the Law of No Collusion.

The Law of Integrity is as follows:

> Players must be as honest and truthful as possible when reporting data to the game.

For example, a player would be breaking the Law of Integrity if they report that they worked 40 hours on a project when they know that they only worked 20.

Much of the data requested is subjective, which is why the law only says "as truthful as possible". Absolute truth is not expected, but players are expected to not willfully distort the truth.

The Law of No Collusion take the Law of Integrity to the group level:

> Players must not conspire with other players to sabotage game procedures.

For example, a player would be breaking this law if they made a pact with other players to vote for or against a particular goal.

Players can try to persuade and influence each other in game procedures like voting and project reviews, but they may not collude to ensure a particular outcome.

It's fine (even encouraged) for players to discuss and debate the meaning of the stats:
- "How do we define measure project quality?"
- "What matters to you when determining culture contribution?"
- "What do you take into account when determining percentage contribution?"

The Law of Collusion forbids players from discussing **actual numbers**. For example:
- "I'm thinking I did about a third of this project? What do you guys think?"
- "It seems to me that our project quality is at 80%. That's what I'm going to say in my review."

If these laws are upheld, then the game maintains its integrity; it is not corrupted.

If these laws are broken, the moderator will step in to rectify and issue a warning. If a player repeatedly breaks them by even after being warned, they may be asked to leave.
