# Basic Gameplay

There are two objectives of the game: to learn, and to contribute to others' learning.

Focus on these two activities and you will succeed.

### Cycles

The game moves forward through a series of 1-week cycles. Everything happens within a cycle; it is the primary game loop.

Every cycle, learners select learning goals, form projects from them, practice their craft in the context of the project, and finish the cycle by reflecting on both the process and the outcome.

### Goal Selection

The first stage of a cycle is called **goal selection**.

During this stage, learners vote on goals from the goal library for their particular craft. The goal library for your craft is located in the appropriate craft repo under the [GuildCrafts][guildcrafts] organization.

Each learner chooses their top two goals from the list. It's best to choose goals that are both _relevant_ to the skills you wish to acquire and appropriately _challenging_ given your current skill level.

Use the `/vote` command to vote on goals.
