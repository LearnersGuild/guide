# Echo

Echo is the primary interface for the LOS and the main system for communication at the Guild. Log in at [https://echo.learnersguild.org/](https://echo.learnersguild.org/).

Echo is under active development. If you notice something that could be better, or you encounter a bug, please log them in the [LOS repo](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/los). We want your feedback. Together we can build a more perfect Learning Operating System.

## Commands

Echo supports a variety of commands for interacting with the game.

These include commands like `review` for reviewing projects, and `vote` for voting on goals.

To issue a command, type a forward slash `/` followed by the command name in the chat window of Echo. You can type commands from any channel.

When you type `/`, Echo will show a menu of the available commands and some hints as to their usage.

For many commands, passing the `-h` or `--help` flag will show you a helpful message about the command.

For example, to get help with the `/review` command, type `/review --help`.

It's also the primary means by which we communicate with each other - we don't send email at Learners Guild. Because we have so many people communicating on a public platform, it's important to observe some shared Guidelines:

## Guidelines

These guidelines are to support us in making the most of this tool while minimizing distractions and maximizing learning:

Managing **OUTPUT**: guidance for managing the volume of posts & notifications we generate:

1. **Be discerning about WHO you tag - almost never use an @all notification.** Only use an @all notification if it's imperative that everyone in the channel read the message you have sent - assume they will, and that therefore you are interrupting the attention and focus of every person in that channel. @all is the equivalent of ringing the gong. Would you ring the gong for this message? Differentiate between "I'dlikeeveryone to read this" and "Everyonemustread this". Posts in the \#watercooler channel, for example,neverwarrant an @all notification, as it is an entirely recreational / optional channel.
2. **Be disciplined about WHEN you post.** Do people need to read your message RIGHT NOW? If not, it doesn't warrant a mid-day @all notification. Unless it is urgent or an emergency, do not use an @all notification between the hours of 9:00am and 5:30pm.

3. **Be thoughtful about WHERE you post.** Post information only in the most highly relevant places. If it's about the office space, use the \#space channel. If it's only relevant to November folks, use the cohort channel. If it's about a movie outing you want to plan, use the \#watercooler channel. If you find yourself posting something in three different channels, ask someone's opinion about where it belongs and only post it there. The \#significant-updates channel should be reserved for content that everyone in the Guild must be aware of in a timely fashion. 

4. **Be stingy about creating new channels:** A new channel should only be created for an entirely new topic that will generate ongoing discussion. The more channel clutter there is, the less likely we are to pay attention.

Managing **INPUT**: guidance for managing the volume of posts and notifications you are fielding and protecting your attention throughout the day:

1. **Choose your channels wisely. **Only join channels that you wish to stay up to date with. To ensure smooth Guild-wide communication, please commit to joining and monitoring the following channels, at a minimum: \#Oakland, \#YouHouseChannel, \#YourCohortChannel, \#significant-updates, and your project team channel for the current week. Choose your other channels carefully, hide or leave channels you're done with. Keep it clean. 

2. **Make Echo a "pull" not "push" experience**.** **Decide whether you'd like to turn desktop notifications for Echo off during the day. Schedule set times that you'll catch up on messages - e.g. before standup, over lunch, and right before you leave. Make Echo work for you, don't work for Echo.

**Special drill down on @all notifications: **

@all notifications are costly for our attention, flow, and productivity. You should almost never use them. Ask yourself: "does everyone really need to know about this?" If the answer is NO, get more strategic about who you tag or where you are posting. If the answer is YES and it's the middle of the day, then ask yourself...

"Do they need to know NOW? Is it worth breaking their attention? Would I ring the gong to announce it? Is it urgent or an emergency?" If the answer is YES, go ahead and post. If the answer is NO, wait to post it before 9:00am or after 5:30pm.

**Use an @all notification for these types of messages:**

\#oakland: @all pools are broken, and being fixed. Ignore them right now, and let's meet at the light side for coach-que presentation _\(Necessary to coordinate the whole group in real-time, ok to post mid-day\)_

\#oakland: @all I got a phone call late last night from Tish, head of our Old Oakland security team, who informed me that she found one of the front doors left ajar around 11:30pm. Please be conscious of making sure the doors are fully closed behind you, especially if you are leaving after 6:30pm. _\(Impacts everyone in the Guild, but not urgent - should be posted before 9:00am or after 5:30pm\)_

**Do NOT use an @all notification for these types of messages:**

\#space: @all if you see a mac charger with a github sticker on it, please let me know. Thanks _\(Not necessary that everyone be notified about the missing charger - those who see the message will keep an eye out\)_

\#oakland: @all leaving early today. See ya'll tomorrow! _\(Not necessary to let everyone know if you have to take off early\)_
