# Levels and Roles

Players advance through various levels. Each level has specific requirements and confers new abilities to the player.

Roles delineate different ways of interacting with the game. Players at all levels have the "Player" role, and as players advance they gain access to new roles.

## Levels

Levels are cumulative, so more advanced levels also include privileges of previous levels.

Every level is a voting pool. In other words, players vote on goals that are in their level with other players in their level.

Advancement is not one-way: players can move backwards if they drop below level thresholds.

### Level Requirements

This table shows each level starting at 0 and advancing to 5 with the criteria for advancing to that level.

#### Moving Up and Back through Levels

Moving up a level is simple: as soon as a player has met **all** of the requirements, they automatically advance.

Moving back a level is the same process. In order for a player to move back a level, any of the their stats have to drop below the thresholds for that level.

### Why levels?

The LOS has levels for many reasons. Mostly, levels are useful to create a structure through which players can advance, giving direction and acknowledgement of real achievement.

Levels support two growth trajectories for learners:

- An arc from scaffolded structure towards informed agency
- An arc from personal development towards community leadership

When they start, players have few options. This limitation is actually a benefit, because it allows new players to focus intensely on their own development: establishing good learning habits, solidifying foundational technical and collaborative skills, developing a fluency with the language and norms of the learning collective.

Players advance by taking on more difficult and challenging work. They push themselves to learn beyond their comfort and capacity, integrate those learnings, and repeat. There will always be greater and more interesting relevant challenges for them to face.

As players advance, they earn more freedom to choose how to spend their time, what skills to focus on, and what work to pursue. With this status comes the accountability (and privilege) to mentor and aid others, to distribute and compound their learnings throughout the collective.

## Roles

There are 3 roles in the LOS.

By default, every learner has the "Player" role.

The other two roles must be earned by advancing to higher levels.
