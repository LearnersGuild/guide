# Levels and Roles

Learners advance through various levels. Each level has specific requirements and confers new abilities.

Roles delineate different ways of interacting with the game. Learners at all levels have the "Learner" role, and as learners advance they gain access to new roles.

## Levels

Levels are cumulative, so more advanced levels also include privileges of previous levels.
Advancement is not one-way: learners can move backwards if they drop below level thresholds.


| Level | XP Pace | Other              |
|:------|:-----|:-------------------|
| 0     | -    | enrolled and on-boarded   |
| 1     | >30  | got some experience, worked on some team goals  |
| 2     | >55  | begin OSS projects                 |
| 3     | >110  | begin coaching, mock interviewing                  |
| 4     | >165  | begin apprenticeship |
| 5     | >220  | begin being a project lead |


## Roles

There are 3 roles in the LOS.

By default, every learner has the "Learner" role.

The other two roles must be earned by advancing to higher levels.

#### Learner

Purpose:
- A learning collective that helps all members find a dignified livelihood

Accountabilities:

- Working on relevant & stretchy goals with other learners
- Learning new skills and abilities
- Improving stats


#### Technical Coach

Purpose:
- Learners are well supported in improving their technical skills & stats

Role Accountabilities:
- Providing technical guidance and advice to learners
- Assisting learners in their project work
- Conducting cognitive apprenticeship sessions with level 1 learners
- Guiding learners by authoring/curating/suggesting appropriate goals for their
- skill/knowledge level
- Authoring/Curating/Suggesting resources for technical growth
- Supporting teams in completing their projects


#### Project Lead (PL)

Purpose:
- Learners have ongoing, maintained, well-managed, real-world projects to work on

Role Accountabilities:
- Maintaining backlog of work issues for project
- Reviewing/giving feedback on project work
- Defining and maintaining quality standards for project
- Conducting cognitive apprenticeship sessions with level 2 & level 3 learners


#### Moderator

Purpose:
- Learning Operating System is Superbly moderated

Role Accountabilities:
- Moderating LOS
- Setting up and maintaining Craft Repo
- Defining, communicating, and enforcing game over conditions for learners
- Defining game play hours
- Defining stats thresholds to optimize for learners who are a bad fit for the guild leaving as early as possible
- Administering Echo users and teams
- Selecting coaches / maintaining coach rotation schedule

### Why levels?

The LOS has levels for many reasons. Mostly, levels are useful to create a structure through which learners can advance, giving direction and acknowledgement of real achievement.

Levels support two growth trajectories for learners:

- An arc from scaffolded structure towards informed agency
- An arc from personal development towards community leadership

When they start, learners have few options. This limitation is actually a benefit, because it allows new learners to focus intensely on their own development: establishing good learning habits, solidifying foundational technical and collaborative skills, developing a fluency with the language and norms of the learning collective.

Learners advance by taking on more difficult and challenging work. They push themselves to learn beyond their comfort and capacity, integrate those learnings, and repeat. There will always be greater and more interesting relevant challenges for them to face.

As learners advance, they earn more freedom to choose how to spend their time, what skills to focus on, and what work to pursue. With this status comes the accountability (and privilege) to mentor and aid others, to distribute and compound their learnings throughout the collective.
