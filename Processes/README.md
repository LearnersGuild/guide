# Processes

Processes have several steps or actions that walk us up to a stated outcome or goal. They’re used to address specific situations or needs, like resolving conflict, or capturing and implementing cool ideas. We don’t have a ton of processes in the playbook, but the ones we do have share some key features that are great for all processes to have:

- Simple: a simple process is easy to understand and follow, making its execution easier.
- Functional: a functional process literally functions - it actually does what it says it’s going to do.
- Productive: a productive process adds value from minimal input instead of costing us time, energy and potentially other resources.
