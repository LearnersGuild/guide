# Clearing: Clear personal tensions swiftly and directly

_Add a note on power dynamics and How these dynamics influence any given interaction, especially interactions that require some type of interpersonal confrontation_

We are human. Personal conflicts will come up as we work/learn together. When you feel that something personal is beginning to get in the way of you working optimally with someone else,**address it directly with them as soon as you can.**

We call this practice "clearing".

Clearing usually involve sharing anything that I'm "holding" in my mind or heart, that's keeping me from feeling "clear" with you.

Clearings come in many different flavors, these are the main three:

* **A Pinch:**Something someone did, that "pinched" my ego. I could let it go, but it's building a small level of resentment, so I'll just say it. For example: "When you didn't respond to that question I asked in the meeting I felt snubbed". Pinches are quick to resolve, and usually don't need more than a "thank you" in response.

* **A Reality Check:**We make up stories all the time about each other. If you notice a belief forming in your mind about someone else, ask them about it. For example: "I noticed that whenever I talk about anything related to marketing, you seem to zone out. I'm starting to make up a story in my mind that you think I'm shitty at marketing. Is there any truth to that?"

An apology can also be another form of clearing.

Sharing reveals in this way, and being heard, can often diffuse the withhold, and reduce its charge.

If you tried to clear a withhold with someone and failed, consider using a[Formal Request Process](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/cos/blob/master/Processes/Conflict.md)to resolve it.

**It's important not to have hidden**[**requests**](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/cos/blob/master/Practice_Tending_Relationship/Requests.md)**or feedback. The implicit request when clearing is to be heard and to be known in order for the air to clear.**
