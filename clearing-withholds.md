\# Clearing: Clear personal tensions swiftly and directly



\*\*Serves Values:\*\* Truth, Safety



We are human. Personal conflicts will come up as we work/learn together. When you feel that something personal is beginning to get in the way of you working optimally with someone else, \*\*address it directly with them as soon as you can.\*\*



We call this practice "clearing".



Clearing usually involve sharing anything that I'm "holding" in my mind or heart, that's keeping me from feeling "clear" with you.



Clearings come in many different flavors, these are the main three:



\* \*\*A Pinch:\*\* Something someone did, that "pinched" my ego. I could let it go, but it's building a small level of resentment, so I'll just say it. For example: "When you didn't respond to that question I asked in the meeting I felt snubbed". Pinches are quick to resolve, and usually don't need more than a "thank you" in response.



\* \*\*A Reality Check:\*\* We make up stories all the time about each other. If you notice a belief forming in your mind about someone else, ask them about it. For example: "I noticed that whenever I talk about anything related to marketing, you seem to zone out. I'm starting to make up a story in my mind that you think I'm shitty at marketing. Is there any truth to that?"



\* \*\*A Reveal:\*\* Sometimes it's important to reveal something about how our mind/heart works in order to clear the air. Reveals can be "negative" or "positive" stories/history/self image that's relevant to how we are relating personally to someone. This is distinctly different from feedback about their work product. For example: "Your accent reminds me of this guy who used to bully me, and sometimes I notice myself mad at you for no reason." or "I really like your writing style. I've always wanted to write like that and sometimes I notice that I feel intimidated and jealous of you."



An apology can also be another form of clearing. 



Sharing reveals in this way, and being heard, can often diffuse the withhold, and reduce its charge.



If you tried to clear a withhold with someone and failed, consider using a \[Formal Request Process\]\(/Processes/Conflict.md\) to resolve it.





\*\*It's important not to have hidden \[requests\]\(Requests.md\) or feedback. The implicit request when clearing is to be heard and to be known in order for the air to clear.\*\*
