# Culture OS

The Culture OS exists to provide a framework by which members of the learning collective can co-create conditions/climate/space/environment/culture that draws out the best in us.

The COS defines the components of our culture, and processes by which participants of the culture can impact it.

Learners Guild embodies this commitment by deliberately creating a culture that supports our ongoing development on a daily basis. An ecosystem of structures, practices, tools, and shared language allow us to do this. Everyone is responsible for embodying and improving this culture.

Critically, we manage our business culture like we manage our learning culture: embodying in our own practices what we expect from our learners and partners. The cultural architecture we develop and implement internally for ourselves will serve as the foundation for the learning culture that we offer to our members.[^1]
