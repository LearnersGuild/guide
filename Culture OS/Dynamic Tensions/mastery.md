We cherish mastery in all that we do, and when possible, raise the salience of this journey for our members, and ourselves.[^1]

[^1] Tory Higgins, ranking professor of psychology and org behavior at Columbia, wrote a masterpiece called Beyond Pleasure and Pain several years ago that summarizes three hundred years of motivation inquiry, complete with 25 years of lab experiments. In essence, he debunks the widely held premise that humans are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain. The experimental data do not show this. Rather, humans are motivated most centrally to seek truth and achieve mastery, and they will endure enormous hardship and deprivation to accomplish these core values. This explains the commonplace observation of the marathon runner, the IronMan competer, just about anyone who seeks a worthy goal and places their comfort and pleasure at risk in order to be more fully human.
