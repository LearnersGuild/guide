# Growth Tension: Safety <--> Truth

We hold the fundamental belief that all people can learn and grow, and are driven by a deep desire to do so.

Everyone at Learners Guild makes a commitment to their own personal development. They also make a commitment to the personal growth of others. We do this as a necessary means of achieving the highest business outcomes, and as an end in itself.

## Safety

- seen
- appreciated
- vulnerability


## Truth

- feedback
- honesty
- transparency

### Building Trust with Truth

Communication and negotiation among groups of people is difficult, but the more honest we can be with each other, the easier it will be for us to trust one another and work together as a team. Openness and honesty will be critical to our success, which is why this is one of our key values, and why it’s a mantra we repeat in many conversations.

The best way for you to make a decision about what’s good for Learners Guild is to have all of the information about what’s going on at Learners Guild. The same is true for everyone else you work with, so it’s important that we’re all up to date about what’s happening, even with the areas of Learners Guild that we’re not actively involved with.

Transparency may seem like a passive process, like "don’t hide anything," but it’s actually a big challenge to keep everyone up to date and on the same page about stuff they’re not working on on a daily basis, even for a company the size of Learners Guild. These are some of the policies we use to make information more accessible, but our work is ongoing.

### Partner-to-Partner Feedback

Feedback given from one partner to another is private unless the partner receiving the feedback wishes to share.

Giving and receiving feedback is an integral part of working at Learners Guild. We acknowledge that in order for us all to continuously grow, we need to be able to give and receive feedback on things that push the edges of our comfort zones. Feedback is vulnerable and thus should be respectful and private.

Partners are, of course, encouraged to share as much of their _received_ feedback as they wish, whether to seek support or to stay in integrity.

### Private Information: When and why information should be private

Choose to make information private if:

- making it transparent could damage the purpose of the organization
- you do not own the information and do not have the owner's explicit permission to make it transparent
- the information directly concerns another partner and you do not have their explicit permission to make it transparent
