# Mindset Orientation

Learners Guild was built from the ground up to be a different kind of learning institution. There are three basic shifts in orientation from traditional schooling that you will need to make, in order to fully benefit from and participate in the Guild.

## Shift 1: From Consumer to Creator

**Education as an investment not a service**

Traditionally, learning's been a one way street. Schools get paid whether you meet your goals or not. All the risk's on you. We think learning should be a two-way deal.

A learning community that invests in learners and only makes money when they win must hit a higher standard or go out of business. That’s what drives our program to be 100% focused on technical, professional and personal skill-building — skills that will lead directly to your success.

Ever since we were four years old, our culture teaches us to interact with institutions as consumers. We pay for something, and we get something in return. Education over the years has been turned into a service: You pay for a degree, or for knowledge, and the institution hands you an education in return.

Learners Guild is setup as a partnership not a service. As an institution, we invest our time and money into you, and our success is aligned with yours. Every partner at the Guild puts aside some of their salary to invest in the learners, and as a company, we raise money from investors and represent them in investing in you. If you fail to get a job, we are all out of a job. All of our livelihood is tied together. Because this an unproven model, the success of it, depends on you, and the ability for learners in the future to join the guild depends on your success.

**Kitchen not restaurant**

Our challenge, is to shift the paradigm together, from a restaurant with a fixed menu, and fixed prices, where learners order an education. To a kitchen, we we're all in it together. Learning and creating side by side.

## Shift 2: From Student to Learner

**Traditional School v.s. Guild**
Traditional schooling, robs us of our power and authority. Ever since we were kids, the locus of authority and control is taken from us. We are taught that an *expert* has the knowledge. They tell us what to learn, when to learn it, they test us and then tell us wether or not we have learned it. Many of us had little or no agency over our learning environment. We even had to ask permission to go pee!

The Guild isn’t school. It’s a hands-on learning environment designed for those with an inner drive to succeed. So we give feedback not grades. We’re about skills not certificates. And we favor collaboration over competition. No teachers here, just mentors. No instruction, just a side-by-side apprenticeship. There's also no fixed curriculum. Knowledge is always evolving, and the name of the game is getting good at researching, acquiring and synthesizing knowledge, not consuming a preset, stale, curriculum. It’s not about what you know, it’s about what you can figure out. Any fixed knowledge today is worth nothing a few years from now.

As a learner, you'll quickly see that there's no "one-right-way", there are multiple answers to most questions. There's guidance, but no central authority. And you'll be learning at your maximum pace, instead of being paced by some external standard.

**Claim your Agency**

Your first challenge at the Guild is to take back your power, and reclaim authority of your learning. The locus of control and authority returns to you.

Authority comes from the word author. The guild works only if you claim authority. Write your own story. Doesn't mean do it alone. There is guidance and support, and you're part of a collective. We get to write the story together. Co-author it.

The degree to which you make this your own story, make this your own Guild, is the degree to which it will work for you.

**More authority = more responsibility**

A system with decentralized, distributed authority, means that each member has more responsibility than a traditional centralized system. At the Guild, your peers depend on you for honest, frequent feedback. They depend on you to drive your learning, author goals, and co-create a learning culture that brings out the best in everyone.

The extra responsibilities are more stressful, and more demanding than a traditional learning environment. The hope is that they help you in developing life-long learning and leadership skills that support you in your career.

**Interesting face: Schools are made my same architecture firms that make prisons**

## Shift 3: From Individual to Collective

It takes a team, full of diverse perspectives and experiences to create the software tools the world needs. Individuals and companies that forget this simple truth risk becoming obsolete. Those who embrace it are the future of technology. That's why our program puts you on a team and in collaboration from day one.

Ever since day one at first grade, most of us have been trained to do it alone. Turning around and helping someone else was seen as cheating. At the Guild, learning is a deeply social activity, and coding is a team sport. Shifting the orientation from "how do I succeed" to "how do we succeed" creates a learning environment that works better for you, and prepares you for a life long career of collaboration.
