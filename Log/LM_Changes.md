# Learning Model Changes

Based on your feedback and what we’ve observed over the past few months, we're making some significant changes to the learning model that will go into effect starting June 19, 2017.

This document outlines the planned changes from a high level. More details to follow.

#### What's going away

- Stats (*and all other **gamified** aspects of the LOS*)

- Non-sequential levels

- Wandering in the wilderness (lack of learning tracks)

#### What's staying

- Project-based learning (at later phases)

- Apprenticeship (at later phases)

- Focus on skill-building

#### New stuff

*- Phases (5 of them, designed to be completed in sequence)*

*- Phase Interviews*

*- Increased technical support (appropriately structured for each phase)*

*- New membership review process based on interviews*

*- Increased structure and guidance in earlier phases (a self-paced, linear curriculum)*

*- More career prep support in final phase*

#### Where to find more information

To learn about Phases and Interviews, check out the new [Phases section](/Phases).

More information will be shared as it becomes available. If you have questions in the meantime, ask a facilitator.

#### The Transition

Moving from a loosely sequenced program to a more structured one is not a simple process. How can we know which learners should be in which phase?

To solve this problem, during the week of 6/19 _everyone_ will participate in one of the three [Phase Interviews](/Phases/Interviews), each of which has its own associated coding challenge.

By 6pm on Friday June 16, 2017, learners must choose whichever interview that they believe most closely aligns with their current skills (using the survey provided), and a facilitator will provide them with the appropriate coding challenge on Monday, June 19.

**Review the phase interviews to learn what it will entail so that you can properly choose and prepare.**

* **LINK TO PHASE 3 INTERVIEW**

* **LINK TO PHASE 4 INTERVIEW**

##### Sorting Interview Process

**Note:** This process is identical *regardless* of which phase interview is being attempted.

SEPs will be available to support for the phase interview coding challenge, and learners should have few or no meetings to attend during that week.

A facilitator will send learners the link to their interview challenge on Monday (6/19) morning. Learners will then have **2.5 days** to work on the coding challenge for the interview and complete as much as they can. Learners _must submit_ their solution/artifact by **1pm on Wednesday** (6/21).

Evaluations and interviews start after lunch on Wednesday and continue until they are done, ideally before 6pm on Friday (6/23).

If learners pass the phase interview they take, they are placed into the next phase. Furthermore, if a learner passes the P4 interview, and has been here more than 32 weeks, they will be allowed to choose whether they’d like to be in P4 or P5.

If learners do not pass the phase interview they choose, they are placed into the previous phase. In this case, they will have one more attempt to pass the interview.

If you don’t pass the Phase Interview you select, the amount of time you have to re-interview for that phase will vary by phase and start date.
