# Learning Model Changes

Based on your feedback, we're making some significant changes to the learning model that will go into effect starting June 19, 2017.

This document outlines the planned changes from a high level. More details to follow.

#### What's going away

- Stats (i.e. most of what the "game" formerly was)

- Levels

- Wandering in the wilderness (lack of learning tracks)

#### What's staying

- Project-based learning (at later phases)

- Apprenticeship (at later phases)

- Focus on skill-building

#### New stuff

- Phases (5 of them, designed to be completed in sequence)

- More support (appropriate to the phase)

- Phase interviews

- New membership review process based on interviews

- Tighter scaffolding & structure at earlier phases

- More career prep & support in final phase

#### Where to find more information

To learn about Phases and Interviews, check out the new [Phases section](/Phases).

More information will be shared as it becomes available. If you have questions in the meantime, ask a Moderator.

#### The Transition

Moving from a loosely sequenced program to a more structured one is not a simple process. How can we know which learners should be in which phase?

To solve this problem, during the week of 6/19 _everyone_ will participate in one of the three [Phase Interviews](/Phases/Interviews), each of which has its own associated coding challenge.

By 6pm on Friday, 2017-June-16, learners must choose whichever interview that they believe most closely aligns with their current skills (using the survey provided), and a facilitator will provide them with the appropriate coding challenge.

If learners pass the phase interview they take, they are placed into the next phase. Furthermore, if a learner passes the P4 interview, and has been here more than 32 weeks, they will be allowed to choose whether they’d like to be in P4 or P5.

If learners do *not* pass the phase interview they choose, they are placed into the previous phase. In this case, they will have *one* more attempt to complete the assessment, according to the following schedule:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Phase Interview Failed</td>
    <td>Learner’s Time @ Guild</td>
    <td>Latest Interview Reattempt Date</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P2</td>
    <td><= 10 weeks</td>
    <td>August 14th</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>> 10 weeks, <= 20 weeks</td>
    <td>July 17th</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>> 20 weeks</td>
    <td>July 3rd</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P3</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>July 17th</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P4</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>July 31st</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Review the phase interviews to learn what it will entail so that you can properly choose and prepare.
