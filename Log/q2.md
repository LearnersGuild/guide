# Change Log: 2017. Q2

Here are some of our takeaways from our staff retreat that we wanted to share with you all:

## Matrix and Goal library

**The Matrix and the Goal Library have been supercritical to everyone focusing on goals that are well defined, that stretch them, and that are challenging.** We initially thought that learners should draw their own map, and author their own goals. While that worked for some people, it didn't work on a large scale for most. It resulted in inefficiencies, and as a result, some of you have gaps in your understanding that shouldn’t be there. The way we are fixing this:

  - We are **extending Guild membership for up to 6 weeks for all July, September, and November cohort** to give you time to make up for inefficiencies in your learning and set you up more for being job ready. If you are getting a stipend, you’ll continue to get it for those 6 weeks. This is optional, and your Income Share Percentage and payback period will **not** be impacted by this.
  - We are **pausing enrollment for a month** to make room for these three cohorts staying 6 weeks longer.
  - Ongoing, we are investing a lot of time and energy in **authoring the goal library**. It’s come a long way, but more work is coming. OSS projects will be snapshot goals (we have 6 new ones for next week). You can still author goals, and work on them, but we’re setting a high bar for what a quality goal is. We’re also looking at ways to build in increasing degrees of agency at higher levels.

## Coaching

**Coaching is one of the things that gives you the most value**. Code reviews that are asynchronous are not as valuable, and more people need/want time with more SEPs.

  - We’ve **hired a part time SEP** (Juliana) who will start next Thursday and help out during the end of the week crunch. She will be here Thursdays and Fridays.
  - Deonna will hopefully be recovered in May and will be back then.
  - We’re removing most other responsibilities from SEPs so they can **focus the majority of their time on being with learners**.
  - We’re using Lead Coaches per project, so **each team has a dedicated coach**, who can then escalate to a SEP.
  - **We’re getting rid of Prrr**. Code reviews will be done in real time, with your coach. It’s more effective that way.
  - **We’re upgrading Coach Queue** to be less calendar based, and more of a Queue so coaching is more efficient and timely.

## More meaningful, simpler stats

We’re going to make a big push to simplify stats, and make them a more meaningful reflection of your progress:

### Better Project Completeness

- Project reviews will now be done by coaches only, and every project will get at least 1 coach reviewing it.
- Moving project reviews back to Friday
- Quality and Completeness specs will be rolled up into one kind of spec: Completeness. (simpler)

### More Meaningful XP

- Number of XP you get will depend on how much of the project is completed. (more meaningful)
- If you do the same goal twice, you only get XP for the better of both attempts. (more meaningful)
- XP will be a much more meaningful stat, and will eventually (5 to 7 weeks) be used for leveling up. (more meaningful, simpler)

### More collaborative, simpler mechanics

- Bonus XP is a new mechanic that’s coming soon. When a team succeeds in completing a project each learner will receive Bonus XP points based on the level of the challenge. So as a team we ALL win more XP if we succeed in completing a project. (more meaningful, less zero sum)
- ELO will be a less important stat, and will eventually only be used only for forming pools and not leveling up (less zero sum, simpler)
- More flexible pools that span levels so folks aren’t "stuck" in a level

## Tighter, more efficient container for learning

- Bringing back stand ups in the morning
- More accountability around time commitments
- More focus on creating a distraction-free, focussed learning environment
- Moving official start time to 9.00 a.m. (8.30 soft start, 9.00 stand ups)

## Better boundary conditions

**The way we’ve been doing boundary conditions has not been working well.** We want to build a system, where learners can get feedback, from their peers, about how well they are tracking towards their goal, and whether or not they are a good fit for the learning model and culture. We’ve tried many different ways of getting there, but we are not yet to a place where the stats are accurate enough to reflect that fully.

**The decision to ask a learner to leave the guild will no longer be made by the stats. Because the stats are not yet accurate enough to gauge fit. That call will need to be made by a person, and for now I will be filling that role as moderator**. Stats (mainly XP) will be used to indicate that the learning model might be a bad fit for someone, and I will use them (and other indicators) to start an investment re-evaluation with learners who may be a bad fit for the program. More about how that works is in the [membership section](/Game_Manual/Membership.md).


_We will not be rolling out all these changes at once, this is just a preview of what is to come. As, I’m sure, you’ve figured out by now, all of the above is subject to change, so please don’t get too attached to any of it. We will keep doing our best to listen, and integrate feedback, and improve what needs to be improved, and give you a heads up about it._
