# Version 1.5 Changes

For many many reasons, we're making some significant changes to the program that will go into effect starting June 19, 2017.

This document outlines the planned changes from a high level. More details to follow.

## What's going away

- Stats (i.e. most of what the "game" formerly was)
- Levels
- Wandering in the wilderness (lack of learning tracks)

## What's staying

- Project-based learning (at later phases)
- Apprenticeship (at later phases)
- Focus on skill-building
- Free coffee

## New stuff

- Phases (5 of them, designed to be completed in sequence)
- More support (appropriate to the phase)
- Phase assessments
- New membership review process based on assessments
- Tighter scaffolding & structure at earlier phases
- More career prep & support in final phase

## Where to find more information

To learn about Phases and Assessments, check out the new [Phases section](/Phases).

More information will be shared as it becomes available. If you have questions in the meantime, ask a Moderator.

## The Transition

Moving from a loosely sequenced program to a more structured one is not a simple process. How can we know which learners should be in which phase?

To solve this problem, during the week of 6/19 _everyone_ will take one of the three [Phase Assessments](/Phases/Assessments). Based on the outcome of this assessment, learners will be placed into either Phase 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We're calling this the **"Sorting Assessment"** because its purpose is to _sort_ learners into the best phase for their stage of learning. Since stats weren't a reliable indicator of level & skill, we're essentially "re-leveling" everyone through a more systematic, objective, and fair process.

If you pass theÂ assigned sorting assessment, you'll go into the following phase (e.g. if you pass the phase 2 assessment, you'll be placed into phase 3). If you fail the sorting assesssment, you'll be assigned to the phase assessed (e.g. if you fail the phase 2 assessment, you'll be assigned to phase 2).

Review your assigned sorting assessment to learn what it will entail so that you can properly prepare.

### Requesting an alternate sorting assessment

If you believe that you should be placed in a different phase than the one you're taking the assessment for, you can request an alternate sorting assessment from your Moderator.

Email Carla or NeEddra before 6pm on Friday, June 16 with your request, and they will let you know which assessment you'll be taking on Monday, June 19.
