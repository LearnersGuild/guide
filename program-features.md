# Program Features

Our program integrates technical learning, social-emotional learning, and career preparation workshops to support participants in long-term personal and professional growth. Each aspect of our holistic program is integral to developing a competitive advantage in your career and general wellbeing in your life.

### Technical Program

The technical program has three progressive phases following the arc of your growth as a developer. The first phase is highly structured and more narrowly focused than the later phases. The idea is that when we’re learning something new, we need more help with figuring out \_what \_we need to learn as well as help with learning it. As we become more competent, we’re increasingly prepared to work on more complex problems \_and \_to self-direct our learning path.

A key feature of the technical program is the apprenticeship-based final phase. Reaching this phase unlocks the ability to work on self-directed projects with the mentorship of our senior engineers. Learners can also elect to work on an existing development team for a live system led by one of our senior engineers.

For more detailed information on the technical program, including engagement expectations, learning modules and how phase progression works please consult the [**Curriculum Guide. **](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org)

Learners primarily engage with the technical program through the Curriculum Guide, the forthcoming Echo web application and the learner Slack instance.

### Omni

There's an expanding body of research proving the interconnectedness of our emotional and cognitive functions, as well as the increased success rate of those who intentionally develop their EQ \(emotional intelligence\) alongside their IQ. Omni is the social-emotional intelligence \(SEI\) track of our program that provides learners with an opportunity to both process their experience of becoming web developers, and distinguish themselves from average web developers by building strong self-leadership abilities.

Omni has three components: SEI workshops, 1-on-1 coaching sessions with Learning Facilitators, and House Meetings.

**SEI Workshops: **There are six experiential workshops in the series covering essential aspects of social-emotional intelligence like self-awareness, adaptability, and self-management. Check the [**Curriculum Guide**](https://curriculum.learnersguild.org/omni/workshops.html) for workshop descriptions.

**1:1 Coaching Sessions:** Each learner is assigned a Learning Facilitator who provides nontechnical coaching support during the learner's time at the Guild. Coaching sessions provide learners with dedicated time to focus on strengths they'd like to continue building, or growth areas in which they'd like to build capacity.

**The House System:** All learners belong to one of the six houses. A house is comprised of learners at various points in their time at the Guild, junior and senior engineers and learning facilitators. Houses meet twice monthly, giving learners an opportunity to offer and receive support from their peers, mentorship and encouragement.

### Career Development

Our Career Development content supports learners in readying themselves for the job search and interview process with resume/online presence support, mock interviews, algorithms practice, and talks from industry insiders, as well as connecting them with potential apprenticeship and job opportunities.
