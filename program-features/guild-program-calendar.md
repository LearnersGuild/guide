# Accessing the Guild Program Calendar

The Guild Program Calendar reflects core program events and optional instruction and community events. The calendar is color coded to help you quickly distinguish between event types. Core instructional time, project time, and house meeting blocks are in blue, checkins and standups are in green. Anything else is in peach \(e.g.: Algonauts, Stress and Anxiety Management Group, Oakland Blockchain Developers Meet-up, etc.\).
