# Mastery Tension

## Challenge <--> Support

We understand that the achievement of mastery is one of the strongest drives in people, and that it can be an intensely fulfilling experience to progress and recognize one’s path towards mastery. We cherish mastery in all that we do, and when possible, raise the salience of this journey for our members, and ourselves.[^1]

We achieve Mastery by co-creating an environment that challenges us out of our comfort zone, and supports us in overcoming these challenges.

## Challenge

- Relevant Stretchy goals
- Zone of Proximal Development

## Support

- Guidance
- Mentorship
- Resources

## Look & Feel

**What’s possible:** An environment that is “high challenge, high support” enables me to accomplish things that I can’t do alone. I’m stretched and pushed into my Zone of Proximal Development, consistently working on challenges that are slightly out of my reach, but that I can effectively tackle with support and guidance.

**Feels like:** Working in my ZPD with adequate support is inherently joyful; I can tell I’m acquiring new skills, growing and developing my capacities. I’m challenged enough to tell I’ve accomplished something at the end of the day, but not so much that I feel consistently defeated or demoralized. There may be moments or even long stretches of frustration and struggle, but it’s in these moments that I feel safe enough to ask for help and the appropriate amount and type of support is available (modeling, coaching, or encouragement). I experience a sense of accomplishment and personal efficacy.

**Looks like:** High engagement, the room is “buzzing”, people are eager to help me (and I’m eager to help them) and tackle problems together. I know how to get help when I need it and where to get it from. When providing help, I know something about the right kind of help to offer (does the person need me to show them? Talk them through it? Encourage them to stick with it through a challenging moment?) High fives, exclamations of success, appreciations, funny dance moves, and encouragement abound.

[^1] Tory Higgins, ranking professor of psychology and org behavior at Columbia, wrote a masterpiece called Beyond Pleasure and Pain several years ago that summarizes three hundred years of motivation inquiry, complete with 25 years of lab experiments. In essence, he debunks the widely held premise that humans are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain. The experimental data do not show this. Rather, humans are motivated most centrally to seek truth and achieve mastery, and they will endure enormous hardship and deprivation to accomplish these core values. This explains the commonplace observation of the marathon runner, the IronMan competer, just about anyone who seeks a worthy goal and places their comfort and pleasure at risk in order to be more fully human.
