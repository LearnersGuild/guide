# Play Tension

## Fun <--> Engagement

The Play Tension optimizes the energies between whole heartedness and fun. We believe that when take ourselves lightly and our purpose seriously, when we approach our practices with wholeheartedness and immerse ourselves in them, we get into the flow, or a state of sustained engagement that generates spontaneous joy.

## What it could look like

What’s possible: An environment that is both high in play and high in seriousness creates a field of purposeful joy. I’m resourced to sustain a high output of energy over a long period of time because the act of working is energizing and joyful.
Feels like: Fun! I’m in a flow state, fully present and immersed in the act of learning. I feel a healthy competitive motivation to exceed my past performance, to “win” at accomplishing the goals I’ve set for myself.
Looks like: Mistakes and failures are a welcome part of the journey towards success. People are laughing, creating inside jokes, developing fun ways to move work forward. People don’t take themselves too seriously.
