> “A true purpose always has ethical and moral content, which can be either implicit or explicit. It is a statement to which all members of the community can say with the wholeness of mind, body and spirit, ‘If we (notice the plural) could achieve that, then my (notice the singular) life would have meaning.’” ~ Dee Hock

# Purpose

As a Learning Collective, we have the following two objectives as our purpose:

1. To provide the opportunity of a dignified[^1] livelihood for everyone.
2. To co-create a culture that draws out the best in us

## Mission

Our mission as a collective is to create the opportunity for anyone who is willing and able to become a professional software developer to be able to do so.

Our Learning Operating System is designed to be self-organizing, rigorously goal-driven, and personally and professionally rewarding.

We support our learning by deliberately co-creating a growth oriented culture that draws out the best in us. All Guild Members commit to step into ownership of our culture.

If we are to achieve our primary objective of creating a dignified livelihood for everyone, then we are all called upon to play in the cultural field on purpose, as our shared purpose.

[^1] Dignity means I'm seen, honored and respected. The work I'm doing honors my potential and my talent, and meets the world's need. I'm working on things that are beautiful, and meaningful. I'm on purpose, and I feel a sense of belonging in the world.
