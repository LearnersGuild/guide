> “A true purpose always has ethical and moral content, which can be either implicit or explicit. It is a statement to which all members of the community can say with the wholeness of mind, body and spirit, ‘If we (notice the plural) could achieve that, then my (notice the singular) life would have meaning.’” ~ Dee Hock

# What is our Shared Purpose as a Learning Collective?

As a Learning Collective, we have the following two objectives as our purpose:

1. To provide the opportunity of a dignified[^1] livelihood for everyone.
2. To co-create a culture that draws out the best in us

## Mission

Learners Guild’s purpose is a dignified livelihood for everyone.

Our mission is to create the opportunity for anyone who is willing and able to become a software developer to do so.

Our learning environment is self-organizing, rigorously goal-driven, and personally and professionally rewarding.

Learning is facilitated by  a growth-oriented culture that draws out the best in us. This growth-oriented culture is made possible by holding pairs of  seemingly paradoxical values that we call Dynamic Tensions.

All Guild Members are invited to step into ownership of our culture. If we are to achieve our primary objective of creating a dignified livelihood for everyone, then we are all called upon to play in the cultural field on purpose, as our shared purpose.

[^1] Dignity means I'm seen, honored and respected. The work I'm doing honors my potential and my talent, and meets the world's need. I'm working on things that are beautiful, and meaningful. I'm on purpose, and I feel a sense of belonging in the world.
