# Mental Health Resources

Being a person is challenging. We all need help sometimes working with troubling emotions or habitual thought patterns that get in the way of us realizing our potential and feeling our best. 

All Guild members have access to periodical onsite 1:1 counseling sessions with Carolyn Moore, LCSW, as well as access to weekly Stress and Anxiety Management group sessions. 

### Scheduling

To schedule a 1:1 session [**click here**](https://calendly.com/carolyn-9) to visit Carolyn's Calendly page and find her next open appointment. From time to time, Carolyn will also post last minute open sessions in the Slack \#general channel. 

### Cancelation Policy

We offer therapy as a service to the learning community. When you schedule an appointment, you're committing to respect Carolyn's time and occupying a slot that another learner could potentially use. If you need to cancel your appointment, you are required to use the steps below to remain in good standing and continue to utilize the service. 

* Therapy appointments require 24 hrs notice to cancel

* To cancel your appointment send Carolyn a DM in Slack \[carolynmoore42\]

* If you havenâ€™t arrived at your appointment within the first 5 minutes, Carolyn will consider it a no-show and offer the time to someone else.

* **If you miss or are late to multiple appointments, we may ask you not to schedule additional appointments for a set amount of time.**

* You can try swapping or offering your appointment to another learner in the \#counseling\_sessions channel as long as this is done prior to the cancelation window. If no one takes your spot, please follow the cancelation steps above.
