Scheduling



\*Cancelation Policy\*

- Therapy appointments require 24 hrs notice to cancel

- To cancel your appointment send Carolyn a DM in Echo \[carolynmoore42\]

- If you haven’t arrived at your appointment within the first 5 minutes, Carolyn will consider it a no-show and offer the time to someone else.

 -If you miss or are late to multiple appointments, we may ask you not to schedule additional appointments for a set amount of time.

 -You can try swapping or offering your appointment to another learner in the \#counseling\_sessions channel as long as this is done prior to the cancelation window. If no one takes your spot, please follow the cancelation steps above.
